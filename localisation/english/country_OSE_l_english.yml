 ose_fortify_west_desc:0 "The most likely frontline, at least on the Osean continent, for a war with Yuktobania will be Cape Landers. We need to think ahead and prepare fortifications on the peninsula in the event that the Yukes manage to make a landing."

 ose_redirect_spending_to_naval_effort_desc:0 "The Osean Maritime Defense Force needs to be well-funded to be able to gain a decisive upper hand over the Yuktobanian Navy. This funding should be re-directed from the Ground Defense Forces to save on costs."
 ose_another_nuclear_buildup_phase:0 "Ramp-up Nuclear Production"
 ose_another_nuclear_buildup_phase_desc:0 "As of now, Yuktobania is suspected to have a larger stockpile of nuclear weapons than we do.

 ose_fund_technological_advancements:0 "Fund Technological Advancements"
 ose_fund_technological_advancements_desc:0 "Victory over an enemy like Yuktobania is going to need more than just an advantage in numbers and smart generals. It will also require a technological advantage that we can leverage to limit our own casualties while maximizing theirs."
 ose_cover_from_the_air:0 "Expand Airforce Test Division"
 ose_cover_from_the_air_desc:0 "The Osean Air Defense Force needs equipment that can technologically overcome the Yuktobanian Air Force. We'll expand our testing division to experiment with more advanced aircraft designs."

 ose_deal_with_the_protests:0 "Deal With The Protests"
 ose_deal_with_the_protests_desc:0 "Our annexation of Belkan land has caused widespread unrest from the local Belkan population. We need to deal with these protests as soon as possible so we can start securing our hold over the land."
 ose_integrate_administration:0 "Integrate Administration"
 ose_integrate_administration_desc:0 "We'll fully integrate the adminsitrations of the acquired Belkan lands.

 ose_integrate_industry:0 "Integrate Industry"

 ose_border_fortifications:0 "Border Fortifications"
 ose_border_fortifications_desc:0 "Though the acquisition of Belkan land was done peacefully and by a legal treaty, the new government in Belka doesn't seem like he's the type to want to keep that treaty in place. We should construct some fortifications on the border with Belka just in case."
 ose_backline_military_infra:0 "Backline Military Infrastructure"
 ose_backline_military_infra_desc:0 "As the specter of war with Belka looms ever larger, it's become clear we need to prepare our Air Defense forces for a fight and construct infrastructure to support a prolonged campaign against the Belkans."

Pacifists and isolationists might not be so fond, however..."
 ose_elections_dockyards:0 "Invest In Naval Transport"
 ose_elections_dockyards_desc:0 "With Osea covering much of the coastline of the world, maritime trade and transportation are integral to our economy and the lives of many Oseans. Promising to improve it will be looked upon positively by Oseans in coastal areas, but it's nearly meaningless to Oseans who live inland."
 ose_elections_industry:0 "Put Money Into Academics"
 ose_elections_industry_desc:0 "Educating the next generation is critical to sustaining employment rates and continuing the country's growth. However, the government meddling in schools is always a shaky topic..."
 ose_elections_army:0 "Remember The Forgotten"
 ose_elections_army_desc:0 "Due to a lack of ground threats, the Osean Ground Defense Force has mostly been left in the dust with funding and support. Reviving it will both make our nation more secure, and likely be appreciated by most citizens. Every penny we spend on them is one less for the Navy or Air Defense Force though..."
 ose_elections_stab_pp_was:0 "The Speech"
 ose_elections_stab_pp_was_desc:0 "Everyone loves a good old charismatic speech to get them going! This should reinforce support within our own party, and potentially pull some swing voters over from the Liberties. "
 ose_menace_of_perbla:0 "Menace Of Perbla"
 ose_menace_of_perbla_desc:0 "The Perblans to the south preach liberty while being friendly with our old authoritarian enemy of Belka. Emphasizing the Perblan threat can win support from anxious swing voters living on our border with Perbla."

 ose_infra_deving_desc:0 "Much of the Osean countryside is underdeveloped, dominated by more trees than people and industry. We'll capitalize on this opportunity by developing that land and creating new industries and towns for Oseans to live and work in."
 ose_rails_dev:0 "Expand Core Rail Systems"
 ose_rails_dev_desc:0 "We'll expand the railway systems of central Osea, which have been somewhat neglected compared to the railway systems of the more urbanized and industrialized south."
 ose_connect_the_land:0 "Connect The Nation"

 ose_cottage_industry:0 ""Cottage Industry" Plan"
 ose_cottage_industry_desc:0 "One of the biggest obstacles to industrial development has been people who oppose any kind of new construction, due to a perceived threat to the "character of the neighborhood." One plan to help with Osean manufacturing while appeasing this extremely vocal group is to encourage the development of "cottage industries," where people would run small businesses out of their own homes."
 ose_open_economic_zone:0 "Expand Nation-wide Economic Zones"
 ose_open_economic_zone_desc:0 "Since the creation of mixed-use zoning is going to be difficult with the current makeup of the public, we'll need to focus on expanding economic zones across the nation."

 ose_chrom_problems:0 "Solve Chromium Shortages"
 ose_chrom_problems_desc:0 "Many of our advanced armored vehicles and tanks require chromium for their construction and for their spare parts. Expanding our chromium excavation capabilities will mean we can produce more of these vehicles and more spare parts for ones that get damaged."
 ose_general_expantion_plans:0 "The Limitless Resources of Osea"
 ose_general_expantion_plans_desc:0 "Osea is a land rich with tapped and untapped resources. We already have extensive resource deposits across the country but we know there are likely hundreds upon hundreds more untapped and undiscovered ones hidden away. We need to find these and exploit them."
 ose_refund_the_land:0 "The Forgotten Branch"
 ose_refund_the_land_desc:0 "The Osean Ground Defense Force has been unfortunately forgotten about due to previous administrations focusing on a prospective war with Yuktobania rather than the notion of a ground war on the Osean continent. We need to get re-fund the OGDF and ensure that Osea proper isn't vulnerable to an invasion."
 ose_to_re_equip_the_man:0 "Guns For All"
 ose_to_re_equip_the_man_desc:0 "Due to a relatively underfunded Ground Defense Force, Osea's infantrymen are being forced to operate with outdated small arms, supportive equipment, and logistical vehicles. Osea needs to procure more modern equipment in order to really fight as a modern force."
 ose_the_heavy_stuff:0 "The Heavy Stuff"
 ose_the_heavy_stuff_desc:0 "Underfunding for the OGDF has left our armored forces technologically behind more modern forces of nations like Belka. We can't allow our armored fist to degrade and be vulnerable to total destruction."
 ose_partialy_rebuilt:0 "Partially Rebuilt"
 ose_partialy_rebuilt_desc:0 "Thanks to a reinvestment into the Ground Defense Force, it's become partially restored to its pre-Cold War strength."
 ose_belka_problem:0 "The Belkan Problem"
 ose_belka_problem_desc:0 "The Belkans to our north are our historic rivals, fighting over the fates of Northern and Eastern Osea for centuries.

 ose_yukto_problem:0 "The Yuktobanian Problem"
 ose_yukto_problem_desc:0 "Yuktobania is our ideological and geopolitical rival across the ocean. For the past few decades, we've been combatting them for influence across the world while posturing for possible military action."
 ose_perbla_problem:0 "The Perblan Problem"
 ose_perbla_problem_desc:0 "The Perblans to the south were formerly friendly with us Oseans. However, political turmoil in the Southern Osean nation led to a change in their domestic and foreign policies to be friendlier to our old enemy of Belka instead."
 ose_new_diplo_policy:0 "The Mackenzie Doctrine"
 ose_new_diplo_policy_desc:0 "President Mackenzie believes that Osea's foreign policy should be based on attempting cooperation with some of our more rivalrous nations and a doctrine of well-armed and prepared pacifism. Not instigating conflicts but being ready and prepared to respond to ones that do appear."
 
 ose_urgent_war_committee:0 "Urgent War Committee"
 ose_urgent_war_committee_desc:0 "Belkan aggression is rapidly reaching an inflection point and an emergency meeting of the National Security Council must be convened to figure out how Osea will respond."
 ose_emergency_army_reforms:0 "Emergency Army Reforms"
 ose_emergency_army_reforms_desc:0 "The Osean Ground Defense Forces are in a dire situation and currently woefully inequipped to properly fight the technologically-advanced and well-trained Belkan Army. Quick reforms must be made to avoid total destruction."

 OSE_congress_party_desc_unity_loc: "Founded in 1869, the Unity Party is Osea's first official political party.\n\nCreated in a time of regionalism and conflict, its founders sought the establishment of a more centralized Osean state and the creation and promotion of a unified national identity.\n\nIn the modern day, it's Osea's mainline conservative party and focused on controlling or neutering threats to the great Osean nation."
 OSE_congress_party_desc_liberty_loc: "Founded in 1891, the Liberty Party is Osea's second oldest official political party.\n\nIt was founded by a coalition of politicians dissatisfied with the Unity Party after the failure of the First Osean War and people opposed to the "big government" and conservative policies of the Unity Party.\n\nIn the modern day, it's Osea's mainline liberal party and focused on increasing personal liberties, improving domestic conditions, and ending extremism abroad."
 OSE_congress_party_desc_nationalist_union_loc: "The Nationalist Union is a coalition of the Osean Brotherhood and Osean Purity Party, two far right militaristic parties.\n\nThe Osean Brotherhood wants to completely abolish with Osea's federal system and turn it into a unitary state and bringing as much of society under the purview of the state as possible.\n\nThe Oured Purity Party is an old school regionalist faction made up of people descended from the leaders of the ancient merchant government of Oured. They uphold Ouredians as superior, treat other Oseans as second-class citizens, and want that to be the law of the land."
 OSE_congress_party_desc_socialist_loc: "Founded in 1901, the Socialist Party of Osea was founded by a group of union bosses and intellectuals in order to expand the rights of Osean workers.\n\nThroughout the early 20th century, the Socialists had little electoral success but succeeded in organizing demonstrations that pressured the Osean government to expand rights Osean workers.\n\nHowever, as the Cold War between Osea and Yuktobania began to develop, the party split over who to support. In a narrow party election, the pro-Yuktobanian faction won the party's leadership and the pro-Osean faction left and merged with the Liberty Party's "Progressive Caucus.""
 OSE_congress_party_desc_monarchist_loc: "Monarchism has never really been a popular ideology in Osea by any means.\n\nAny monarchists that do exist are few and far between with little to no coordination and mostly isolated to extremist internet forums."
 OSE_congress_party_desc_independent_loc: "Independents describe a group of people who do not align with any of the parties or ideologies listed above.\n\nThis is either because they don't believe in participating in partisan politics out of principle, because their support of a party often swings drastically between elections, or because they don't feel any of the established parties or groups adequately represents them."
