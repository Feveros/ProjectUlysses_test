 sap_1991_parliamentary_elections: "1991 Parliamentary Elections"
 sap_1991_parliamentary_elections_desc: "The 1991 Sapinish parliamentary elections will be extremely pivotal for our nation's future as it's the first election since the constitutional reform in 1990. Will the Republicans win and steer the country towards democracy, making everyone more equal in the process, or will the old guard rein in the reform and bring back the "good old days?""
 sap_1991_republican_victory: "Republican Victory"
 sap_1991_republican_victory_desc: "The United Republican Front has successfully won the 1991 elections, giving them a popular mandate to turn Sapin into a truly modern, democratic society like our old ally of Osea."
 sap_reinforce_state_secularism: "Reinforce State Secularism"
 sap_reinforce_state_secularism_desc: "The 1990 Constitutional Reform included a pledge for official state secularism. We will make good on that promise and reinforce state secularism in Sapin, though of course allowing any private individual to worship as they wish."
 sap_rein_in_the_church: "Rein In The Church"
 sap_rein_in_the_church_desc: "The Catholic Church has enjoyed great privilege over the course of Sapin's history. While we will allow for people to join and practice its faith, we need to rein in its control over national politics and governance."
 sap_establish_a_public_school_system: "Establish A Public School System"
 sap_establish_a_public_school_system_desc: "For years, Sapin's education has relied on a system of private and Church-run schools, with the only government-backed educational institutes being military academies. We are far behind our neighbors in this regard and need to establish a proper public school system."
 sap_regent_domingo_escalona: "Regent Domingo Escalona"
 sap_regent_domingo_escalona_desc: "One of the powers given by the 1990 Constitutional Reform was the ability for the parliament to recommend a Crown Regent to the ruling monarchy to act as a "guardian" for the heir should the monarch be unavailable and next-in-line to the throne given the current monarch dies before the heir is of age. We will recommend the progressive aristocrat Domingo Escalona as Crown Regent."
 sap_increase_taxes_on_nobility: "Increase Taxes On The Nobility"
 sap_increase_taxes_on_nobility_desc: "The nobility has enjoyed the privilege of little to no taxation for centuries, leading to most of the historic tax burdens being shifted to the poor of the country. This is an unsustainable system where the highest earners are contributing almost nothing to government revenue and will be rectified."
 sap_increase_social_spending: "Increase Social Spending"
 sap_increase_social_spending_desc: "Sapin has historically not had very strong government-backed social programs. Most forms of "public service" were carried out through the Catholic Church which, while effective, allowed for individual churches to turn away people at a whim based on personal bias and bigotry. By transferring that responsibility to the democratic government and its agencies, no one will be left behind."

 sap_economic_intervention_desc: "With the current economic crisis, it's vitally important that the government directly intervene into the economy in order to help relieve the suffering of the common citizen."

 sap_the_welfare_state: "The Welfare State"

 sap_the_ustio_ratio_situation_desc: "To the north of us, the nations of Ustio and Ratio are in a territorial dispute over the region of eastern Ustio filled with ethnic Ratians. The Ustians claim the land due to it being part of their borders as a Belkan state but the Ratians claim the land due to them being majority Ratian. Who should we support in this conflict?"
 sap_the_belka_problem: "The Belka Problem"
 sap_the_belka_problem_desc: "The Belkans to the west of us have historically been our enemies, constantly picking fights with us and eventually taking the region of Futuro. We need to decide how to approach "the Belkan problem" in the future."
 sap_our_friends_in_oured: "Our Friends In Oured"
 sap_our_friends_in_oured_desc: "Oured has been one of our strongest and oldest allies in the Osean continent, being known to throw its weight around to assist us when needed so long as we help them in turn.

 sap_an_expeditionary_army: "An Expeditionary Army"
 sap_an_expeditionary_army_desc: "Sapin needs to organize its army for operations outside of the Sapinish homeland. It will require a lot of money and training to do so, but we cannot be an idle member of the world stage."
 sap_north_osean_treaty_organization: "North Osean Treaty Organization"
 sap_north_osean_treaty_organization_desc: "Though our alliance with Oured has been beneficial, it's time for us to go our own way and forge our own path in the world. We'll begin by establishing our own security treaty in Northern Osea for collective defense against any invader of the region."
 sap_our_perbla_position: "Our Perbla Position"
 sap_our_perbla_position_desc: "Our relationship with Perbla has been complicated as of late. For centuries, the royal houses of both nations have intermingled and enjoy amicable relations. However, our alignment with Osea, who dislikes the recent actions of the Perblans, has made our relationship with Perbla strained. This status quo is unsustainable and we need to decide on a concrete position."
 sap_our_border_policy: "Our Border Policy"
 sap_our_border_policy_desc: "Sapin's relative economic superiority over the rest of northern Osea has led to a lot of immigrants from nearby nations moving to Sapin.

 sap_sapinish_national_guard: "Sapinish National Guard"

 sap_a_defensive_army: "A Defensive Army"
 sap_a_defensive_army_desc: "As nice as an expeditionary force may sound, Sapin does not have the finances or political will to sustain a long-term expeditionary armed force. We'll stick with having a strong defensive army to protect our immediate borders."
 sap_reform_the_high_command: "Reform The High Command"
 sap_reform_the_high_command_desc: "The Sapinish military high command has been plagued with issues for decades. Being largely made up of aristocrats and nobles, appointed mostly through personal connections, the army high command is plagued with incompetence and nepotism. If we want to have a proper military force, we'll need to reform the high command and modernize it. Rewarding merit and skill rather than connections and social status."
 sap_1991_monarchist_victory: "Monarchist Victory"

 sap_grant_church_autonomy: "Grant Church Autonomy"
 sap_grant_church_autonomy_desc: "The Catholic church is a long-standing staple of Sapinish society. Unfortunately, the Constitutional Reform restricted some of its powers and authority. We need to restore its autonomy so it can do its duty."
