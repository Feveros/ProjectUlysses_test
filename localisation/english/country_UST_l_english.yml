 ### IDEAS ###
 
 UST_militia_army:0 "Militia Army"
 UST_militia_army_desc:0 "With Ustio's independence extremely recent, our army is rather disorganized and mostly consists of reorganized paramilitaries and militias. While this does mean the troops we have are extremely used to our local terrain and are well-trained, it makes organizing them difficult, as well as they have little to no experience with heavier, conventional equipment."
 UST_undeveloped:0 "Undeveloped Economy"
 UST_undeveloped_desc:0 "Having been reliant on Belka for so long, our economy has not been developed to stand on it's own, and our nation will require heavy reorganization to stand on our own two feet."
 UST_freedom:0 "Ustian Freedom"
 UST_freedom_desc:0 "Even through years of occupation, the Ustians are a proud people and will never let anything get in the way of their freedom. It has been proven, time and time again, that Ustio will always be free."
 UST_ratio_nationalists:0 "Ratian Nationalists"
 UST_ratio_nationalists_desc:0 "Our eastern territories, conquered by Belka, were given to us when our secession occured, however we do not have a strong grip on these territories, as their population is mostly Ratian. With the loss of Belkan security, recently resistance groups and nationalists have become emboldened, and the territories become more unstable by the day."

 UST_enduring_spirit:0 "Enduring Spirit"
 UST_enduring_spirit_desc:0 "Ustio's spirit is like a phoenix that will rise from the ashes no matter how many times its flame is quenched. No matter the odds stacked against us, Ustio shall prevail."
 
 UST_first_strike:0 "First Strike"
 UST_first_strike_desc:0 "We are taking advantage of Ratio's unpreparedness to break through their defences and force them into an unfavorable position. However, this needs to be done quickly or else we will falter and we may come under scrutiny for our invasion."
 UST_freedom_fascism_1:0 "Ustian Stubbornness"
 UST_freedom_fascism_1_desc:0 "Ustian patriotism goes beyond a simple love for the state or the government. Ustians are loyal to the idea of an Ustian nation, even when one may not exist. This gives every Ustian the power to fight as a whole army, no matter the state of their government or formal military."
 UST_freedom_fascism_2:0 "Ustian Nationalism"
 UST_freedom_fascism_2_desc:0 "To be Ustian is among the highest honor someone could have. There is no other people on Earth that have the resiliance, the strength, and the courage as an Ustian."

 UST_sorton_act_idea:0 "Sorton Act"
 UST_sorton_act_idea_desc:0 "Allowing the people in our nation to arm themselves will make it harder for any enemy to invade, as our people become a guerilla force that cannot be contained."

 ### FOCUSES ###
 UST_start:0 "With Freedom In Our Hearts"
 UST_start_desc:0 "The nation of Ustio has been under the control and occupation of Belka for over a century. However, in 1988 the Belkan Federal Law Review finally allowed our nation to be free again. With this in mind, the coming year is full of hope for us as we re-assert ourselves."
 UST_tyran_industry:0 "Expand Tyrann Industry "
 UST_tyran_industry_desc:0 "Tyrann, one of our easternmost cities, has lots of flat, undeveloped land ripe for industrialization. To help kickstart our economy, it would be wise to invest into more factories and infrastructure in the area."
 UST_connect_miedzyrzecz:0 "Connect Solis Ortus"
 UST_connect_miedzyrzecz_desc:0 "Solis Ortus, a somewhat isolated town on our southern border, is a important location in the Tyrann Mountains. Improving transportation to and from the town will help us in connecting our nation as a whole."
 UST_pay_for_museum:0 "Finance The Museum"
 UST_pay_for_museum_desc:0 "Under Belkan rule, we were forbidden and restricted from many of our traditions, as well as major parts of Ustian history were censored.

 UST_upgrade_schooling_system:0 "Upgrade Schooling System"
 UST_upgrade_schooling_system_desc:0 "Our school system is still heavily built on Belkan curriculum and education policies. Distancing ourselves from this will ensure the next generation will not be taught Belkan lies."
 UST_ratio_military_bases:0 "Eastern Military Bases"
 UST_ratio_military_bases_desc:0 "Belka has established a number of forts and defenses on our eastern border. While now defunct, rebuilding and retrofitting these will be far less expensive than attempting to build entirely new ones."
 UST_anti_partisant_training:0 "Anti-Partisan Training"
 UST_anti_partisant_training_desc:0 "Our eastern territories are primarily Ratian by culture, and as a result many partisans are rebelling against our government and causing attacks in the region. Until a more permanent solution can be achieved, we must work to stop the spread of violence."
 
 UST_deal:0 "Deal With Ratio"
 UST_deal_desc:0 "The lands of Tyrann and Boikos do not belong to us. Their rightful owner, Ratio, had them stolen away by Belka some time ago. However, the Ratians have proven themselves a trustworthy people and friendly to us, and it would be both and wrong and futile to lay claim to their lands. They have offered to purchase their lands from us for a number of wonderful benefits, and we happily accept."
 UST_no_step_on_our_land:0 "Not A Single Step On Our Land"
 UST_no_step_on_our_land_desc:0 "The Ratians believe they deserve some sort of right to our lands, now that the Belkans have withdrawn from them. Ustian blood was spilled for this soil, and it is us who have fought to preserve and develop it. We will prove to the Ratians that these lands are Ustian, and will always be."
 
 UST_promised_payment:0 "Promised Payments"
 UST_promised_payment_desc:0 "As a show of good faith, the Ratian government has paid us a generous sum of money in exchange for the territories sold to them. This, combined with lowered expenses from less territory, will help us greatly in developing our core land for the next year."

 UST_resetle_the_people_desc:0 "A clause of the agreement with Ratio is that any Ustian citizens from the lands sold to Ratio who wish to remain in Ustio will be freely allowed to re-immigrate into our nation, with Ratio paying for most of the expenses. As the people begin to trickle in, we will do our part in resettling them quickly and efficiently back into our country."
 UST_move_part_of_industry:0 "Move The Industry"
 UST_move_part_of_industry_desc:0 "Factories, businesses, and other improvements build by Ustio have been allowed to move back into our country after Ratio purchased the land they existed on, as a clause of the agreement between us. They have all packed their things and prepared for the move, and now it is our turn to make sure they are resettled easily and can reopen as soon as possible."
 UST_mid_1992:0 "1992 Elections"
 UST_mid_1992_desc:0 "With the domestic issues at hand mostly resolved, the people's minds have turned to the upcoming election between the incumbent Grzegorz Naruszewicz and his main opposition, Kuba Morkawiecki. Currently, Naruszewicz has a large lead, but in the time between now and the election, anything could change that."
 
 UST_grzegorz_wins:0 "Naruszewicz Victory"
 UST_grzegorz_wins_desc:0 "Grzegorz Naruszewicz, the "Father of Ustio," has secured another term for his government, proving extremely popular to the nation for his unwavering commitment to the nation's future. Though he is wishing to retire, he is committed to ensuring Ustio is strong and ready to face the future before he does so."
 UST_father_continues_his_rule:0 "Father Continues His Rule"
 UST_father_continues_his_rule_desc:0 "The first leader of our nation, and a strong supporter of our independence before that, Naruszewicz is a figure respected by many, even some of his opponents. The victory of another term for him has been celebrated greatly throughout our country, and the people are more ready than ever to work alongside him for the nation's future."
 UST_another_term_await:0 "Another Term's Plans"
 UST_another_term_await_desc:0 "Naruszewicz is preparing a speech to the nation after his election victory, to address his ideas for the incoming term and plans for allowing Ustio to look intoi the future with bright hope. The nation is still young and faces many hurdless ahead but with Naruszewicz at the head we have nothing to fear."
 UST_loyalty_of_the_army:0 "Loyalty Of The Army"
 UST_loyalty_of_the_army_desc:0 "Franek Dolas, head of the Ustian army is an old friend of Naruszewicz and holds unending respect for him. A huge part of the army also has unwavering support for the President. This gives him almost total control over the Armed Forces allowing him to not only shape them into the form he desires but also as a good propaganda tool to rise national support for Ustio's militia."
 UST_allies_in_the_church:0 "Allies In The Church"
 UST_allies_in_the_church_desc:0 "Ustio has always been quite a religious nation, which for years was not only a unifying force during the Belkan occupation, but also as a tool of national propaganda. Naruszewicz has huge support among clergy who will gladly support him and preach of his good name, only increasing his almost total national support."
 UST_continue_school_reform:0 "Continue School Reform"
 UST_continue_school_reform_desc:0 "To rekindle our national spirit, President Naruszewicz has created a new mandatory Ustian Culture class for primary schools, teaching students national traditions, religious practices, and an expanded history, ensuring the next generation of Ustians continue their dedication to the nation."
 UST_centralise_power:0 "Centralise Power"
 UST_centralise_power_desc:0 "President Naruszewicz's population has nearly reached unanimous levels. Seeing the opportunity to make even more changes to stablize Ustio for the future, he has proposed a new act allowing him to bypass certain levels of government to enact more changes. While some are calling this a tyrannical power grab, the President's high approval makes many support this."
 UST_friends_in_osea:0 "Friends In Osea"
 UST_friends_in_osea_desc:0 "Osea has long supported Ustian resistance movements with equipment and funding prior to our independence, in addition to hosting and protecting many Ustian exiles from Belka. President Naruszewicz has reached out to Osea again to reaffirm their comittment to us, even in our now achieved independence."
 UST_nationalize_post_belkan_land:0 "Nationalize Post Belkan Property"
 UST_nationalize_post_belkan_land_desc:0 "Many old Belkan government owned factories and businesses still linger in Ustio, now having been abandoned. Rather than let these go to waste, we will nationalize and repurpose these for our own benefit."
 UST_1:0 "Osean Army Instructors"
 UST_1_desc:0 "Osea is a rather rich country, and is able to spend large amounts of money on their military. Having Osean army instructors sent over to help train our army will get them in better shape, and allow us to coordinate better with Osea in the event of Belkan attack."
 UST_I_AM_SEXO:0 "The Repopulation Act"
 UST_I_AM_SEXO_desc:0 "Throughout occupation, Belka attempted to "Belkanize" our nation through displacing people and migrating Belkans into our nation. This has caused the Ustian population to decline in favor of Belkans. We will expand support networks and funding to Ustian families and couples and encourage them to have more children."
 
 UST_kuba_wins:0 "Morkawiecki Victory"
 UST_kuba_wins_desc:0 "In a suprising twist, Kuba Morkawiecki, a prominent businessman from Directus, was able to sway enough people to his cause and secure majority in the presidential elections. With this upset, times of change will surely come to Ustio."
 UST_new_man_at_the_top:0 "New Man At The Top"
 UST_new_man_at_the_top_desc:0 "For quite a while, the people and government have believed Naruszewicz to be the only man capable of leading Ustio. Many of his friends and allies are still in government, and we will need to either bring them around or sweep them away for our planned changes."
 UST_liberal_shock:0 "Liberal Shock"
 UST_liberal_shock_desc:0 "Kuba Morkawiecki is a huge supporter of liberal policies and an overall free-market ideology of little intervention in the economy from the government. He has already started pushing acts and new laws through the government with the goal of widespread reforms to create a completely new Ustio. A new nation is his eyes should be free, self governing and self-determining."
 UST_seperate_everything:0 "Seperate Everything"
 UST_seperate_everything_desc:0 "Central government should not force itself on local administration. The government's job is to be a nation outside when the people form the nation inside. It is the people themselves who know best how to grow and expand their local surroundings. In the spirit of that idea, President Morkawiecki has decided to push a number of reforms to give local administrations more power and freedom of choice."
 UST_decentralize_army:0 "Decentralize Army"
 UST_decentralize_army_desc:0 "To this day Ustian Army has been a very highly centralized and stiff organization, with both Dolas and Naruszewicz having almost total control over its actions. With new reforms the President will lose most of the central control over it and we will instead promote independant actions from local officers. This way we will make our forces act, plan and react more quickly."
 UST_directus_university:0 "Directus University"
 UST_directus_university_desc:0 "A university is where people learn, expand their horizons, and develop their identity. Because of this importance, universities will be heavily deregulated, allowing for any idea to be tested and tried against others. This mixing of ideas will allow future generations of Ustian citizens to lead this nation into a bright future with their experience and dreams."
 UST_free_rule:0 "Free Rule"
 UST_free_rule_desc:0 "To make certain things illegal does not stop these things from happening, rather it merely maks normal people into criminals. We will limit the government's control on the personal freedom of individuals with new privacy and protection laws, which will make them free to be their true selves."
 UST_open_to_anyone:0 "Open To Anyone"
 UST_open_to_anyone_desc:0 "There is no reason why we should keep all of our nation's benefits to ourselves. Ustio will be a shining beacon of freedom for all in the world to see and visit, and if they so wish, they may join with us, further increasing our prosperity."
 UST_privatize_post_belkan_land:0 "Privatize Post Belkan Property"
 UST_privatize_post_belkan_land_desc:0 "Many of the former Belkan installations are still of good quality to be used. In the spirit of the free market, these shall be refurbished and resold to the highest bidder, a symbolic image of how liberty will always overcome authority."
 UST_sorton_act:0 "Sorton Act"
 UST_sorton_act_desc:0 ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free Ustio, and the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." - Text of Sorton Act, The 11th Amendment of the Republic of Ustio Constitution"
 UST_2:0 "Laissez-Faire"
 UST_2_desc:0 "A free economy is a happy and growing economy. Factory owners, small businessmen, and investors should be allowed to do as they see fit - to expand, to grow. The hand of the free market will guide us to prosperity. Transactions between private groups of people will be free from any form of economic interventionism by the law itself."
 
 UST_two_year_plan:0 "Two Year Plan"
 UST_two_year_plan_desc:0 "Due to occupation and negligence from Belkan central authorities, our economy, and especially the heavy industry sector was never fully developed in our territory. After independence, we have been mostly forced to survive on long-term loans and the industry we inherited on Ratrio's land. But now we finally were able to secure the economic basis to lift ourselves up and expand to a proper modern nation."
 UST_expand_mines:0 "Expand National Mines"
 UST_expand_mines_desc:0 "Usto lays on huge, still not fully surveyed, veins of underground minerals and resources. Excavation and export of those natural goods should be the main pushing forces to fund our expanding economy, and will give us the necessary basics to later process those goods ourselves."
 UST_expand_west_ustio:0 "Western Ustian Investments"
 UST_expand_west_ustio_desc:0 "With the recent acquisition of our old western lands from Belka, we have received another huge economic zone which we can expand. With negligence in the past, even this land requires investments, mainly in the infrastructure and railway departments. Thankfully, those projects are cheap enough to finish and will surely raise traffic and goods transportation inside our nation."
 UST_fruit_of_earth:0 "Fruits Of The Earth"
 UST_fruit_of_earth_desc:0 "A recent survey has found a previously undiscovered a vein of metals in the southern Tyrann Mountains. This revelation was immediately followed by plans of constructing new mines to start profiting from the finding as soon as possible. Our calculations are already showing that this investment will pay itself back in less than a year with the level of mining exports our nation is having right now."
 UST_to_modernise_fully:0 "To Modernise Fully"
 UST_to_modernise_fully_desc:0 "A huge portion of our factories still operate on outdated machinery and equipment. Sometimes assembly lines are forced to use 10 year old tools or send people to work in improper safety equipment. It has been decided that the government will launch huge a founding project in which we will try to acquire necessary equipment and donate them to key industrial facilities around the nation."
 UST_money_for_military_complex:0 "Money For The Military Complex"
 UST_money_for_military_complex_desc:0 "Our arms industry and the army itself still lag behind due to a lack of funding since our independence. With our economy partially modernized, it has been decided that our budget must raise spending for those two branches of our nation so we will never fall to enemy invasion again."
 UST_no_more_lagging_behind:0 "No More Lagging Behind"
 UST_no_more_lagging_behind_desc:0 "With our economy humming and our factories brought on par with the rest of the world, we can now start taking notes and learning from others to keep our factories updated and relevant in the modern world. Ustio is no longer yesterday's backwater, she will be the superpower of tomorrow."
 
 UST_establish_central_bank:0 "Establish Central Bank"
 UST_establish_central_bank_desc:0 "Rather than rely on Osean or Belkan notes for our currency, our desposits of precious minerals allow us to create our own mint, making our economy far less reliant on our neighbors and allowing us to serve our own people easier."
 UST_national_labor_board:0 "National Labor Board"
 UST_national_labor_board_desc:0 "Workers and farmers are critical pillars of society, and if they choose so, our nation can crumble in weeks. Ensuring that the blue collar workers of Ustio will have a lifeline to the government will decrease disconnect, and allow us to assist them greater than before."
 UST_valais_industry:0 "Valais Industry Intervention"
 UST_valais_industry_desc:0 "Valais is a rather underpopulated region, however it's strategic importance as a heavily defendable area makes it vital in the event of an attack. Building some industry here, while difficult to maintain and staff, will increase the value and reduce the maintenance of our base there, and will also allow us to dig in further in the event of the loss of our main territory."
 UST_social_country:0 "Social Country"
 UST_social_country_desc:0 "Let it be known throughout the world that Ustio does not leave it's people behind. Increasing social support for the impoverished, the disabled, the elderly, and all who struggle in life will show that we are a nation who cares about all its people, not just the ones who work or fight."
 UST_deregulate_banking_sector:0 "Deregulate Banking Sector"
 UST_deregulate_banking_sector_desc:0 "Ustio has not had it's own currency in a very long time, but why should it? We are in a unique position as one of the few nations who accepts both Osean and Belkan currency. Expanding our accepted currencies to as many as we can find will turn Ustio into an exchange hub, and we will be a critical lifeline in the international trade."
 UST_outlaw_trade_unions:0 "Outlaw Trade Unions"
 UST_outlaw_trade_unions_desc:0 "Trade unions are comprised of people who act like they know more than they do, and are always a thorn in the side of economic prosperity. Outlawing these will allow businesses to have more control over their expenses, and will empower workers to be particular about their job choices rather than bending laws to their advantage."
 UST_hand_of_free_market:0 "Hand Of The Free Market"
 UST_hand_of_free_market_desc:0 "Economics has shown it can regulate itself, and the government's meddling only sabatoges it. Going hands-off on banks, businesses, accounting firms, and trade businesses will help them flourish, enriching the people and the land."
 UST_privatize_healthcare:0 "Privatize Healthcare"
 UST_privatize_healthcare_desc:0 "It is the right of a business to decide how much their services are, and it would be wrong for the government to enforce a standard on them. Privatizing healthcare will diversify it, and individual citizens will be able to purchase plans at costs according to their needs, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all scenario."
 
 UST_they_are_coming:0 "They Are Coming"
 UST_they_are_coming_desc:0 "While never outright renouncing their claims on our land, Belka has just proclaimed a renewed claim, declaring that the 1988 Federal Law Review and our state are illegitimate. This is, in all but name, a declaration of war against us, and we must surmount a defence as soon as possible."
 UST_get_people_ready:0 "Get People Ready"
 UST_get_people_ready_desc:0 "We do not have nearly the physical strength of Belka, and desperately need more troops if we are even to mount any defence. Sweeping conscription and resistance arming will be done to prepare our people as much as can be done."
 UST_make_shift_bunkers:0 "Makeshift Defense Line"
 UST_make_shift_bunkers_desc:0 "Our nation is small, and every bit of land lost will damage our ability to continue fighting greatly. The best location to stop the Belkan armies is on our mountainous western border. However, we do not have the time to set up full defences, so we will scramble as much as possible to get even the most basic defences up in preparation for Belka."
 UST_convert_production:0 "Convert Factories"
 UST_convert_production_desc:0 "Civilian factories are critical to economic growth, but that is the least of our concerns right now. Converting civilian factories and production to military will assist in the short build-up time we have left."
 UST_import_MANPATS:0 "Import MANPATS"
 UST_import_MANPATS_desc:0 "Belka posesses a large amount of armored vehicles, which we do not have to counter them. Importing infantry anti-tank weapons from Osea is the only option we have at countering their armor."
 UST_ask_ratio_for_help:0 "Ask Ratio For Help"
 UST_ask_ratio_for_help_desc:0 "In return for Tyrann Valley and Boikos, Ratio offered us a pledge of support in case we need it. While this was mostly just a kind gesture, it appears we may need it after all. Ratio is unlikely to join in a war with us, but they are nowhere near friendly with Belka, and would likely be more than willing to send us supplies and volunteers to help us defend."
 
 UST_rush_the_trenches:0 "Rush The Trenches"
 UST_rush_the_trenches_desc:0 "To hold a much bigger and heavily equipped Ratian Army we will be required to expand the line of trenches and defences on our border to not get rolled by their armored divisions. This should buy us enough time to localize and target their main attack axis and hold their entire advance. However, this project will cost us, and we must take some loans to pay for it."
 UST_the_speach:0 "Presidential Speech"
 UST_the_speach_desc:0 "President Naruszewicz has decided to personally address the entire nation in official and public appearances on TV and radio. Our nation is going down a dark path and our "Father" has decided to take the center stage in the incoming conflict to rally people to the cause and boost national morale."
 UST_to_arm_the_man:0 "To Arm The Men"
 UST_to_arm_the_man_desc:0 "Our Army is in no way armed and ready to face the enemy in the upcoming conflict. In desperation, we have launched a project to buy and acquire any weaponry we could lay our hands on. It will hit us in the pocket but without them, we will have no chance to hold Ratio's advance."
 UST_last_second_mobilization:0 "Last Moment Mobilization"
 UST_last_second_mobilization_desc:0 "To hold the enemy we need soldiers. The government has decided to push, in a record time of one day, a Mobilization Act which will attempt to double the size and reinforce our army with fresh recruits. Thankfully, support for the war is high enough that our citizens are ready and willing to die in defense of our borders."
 UST_supress_partisants:0 "Supress Partisans"
 UST_supress_partisants_desc:0 "We are still struggling with some partisan resistance on our territory and with upcoming conflicts. We cannot allow ourselves to be weakened by their actions, especially if they strike in coordination with Ratio's army. Due to this, we will enforce total martial law in our eastern provinces. Any suspicious actions or resistance during military checkups will be answered with force - no exceptions."
 UST_external_arms_market:0 "External Arms Production"
 UST_external_arms_market_desc:0 "We have been able to find a few willing nations that will, for a heavy sum of money, divert some of their production facilities for us to borrow. This way we will secure additional arms before and during the war, while at the same time, those factories and assembly lines will be outside of any strike range of Ratio's forces during the conflict itself."
 UST_band_of_brothers:0 "Band Of Brothers"
 UST_band_of_brothers_desc:0 "We are facing a huge influx of volunteers to the army from people who were not called to arms in general mobilisation. We never planned for such an influx of men so we have drafted a new plan to gather all those volunteers and form a new division with special honours called the "Band of Brothers". They will be rushed through special harsher training to bring them to levels of our main fighting force."
 UST_strike_first:0 "§RStrike First§!"
 UST_strike_first_desc:0 "Negotiations are still underway but they would never lead to any peaceful conclusion and Ratio's invasion is more than guaranteed. However, some of the more radical politicians and part of the armed forces proposed something that can be considered madness - a preemptive strike on the enemy. It's risky and if put into motion will paint us as an aggressor, but if successful we will win everything."
 
 UST_we_won:0 "We Won"
 UST_we_won_desc:0 "Our gambit has paid off, and Ratio has been chased from our soil. At the cost of many of our people, and our international reputation, Ustio has remained whole. However, after these actions, the only way left to go is further down. This will not be the last battle."
 UST_we_lost:0 "We Lay Defeated"
 UST_we_lost_desc:0 "Our attacks have failed, and the small army we mustered has been broken by the enemy. While we may go dark, history has proven to us that still, even in the darkest of nights, Ustio cannot and will never die."
 UST_wave_of_nationalism:0 "Wave Of Nationalism"
 UST_wave_of_nationalism_desc:0 "Despite the shift in policy, we still faced moderate opposition to our aggressive action. However, now seeing the results of the attack, criticism has dwindled away and a wave of nationalism has swept over our nation for our success, with many calling for more militarization."
 UST_spoils_of_war:0 "Spoils Of War"
 UST_spoils_of_war_desc:0 "Part of the peace agreement with Ratio was a huge sum of money as war reparations. Due to a lack of such funds on hand, it has been decided that the transfer would instead be conducted in the form of industrial material. This will greatly benefit us due to the ability to immediately profit from our won spoils and help put our economy back into working condition."
 UST_ustian_stubbornness:0 "Ustian Stubbornness"
 UST_ustian_stubbornness_desc:0 "We once again showed that the Ustian people will never surrender to any aggression or oppression. Like we resisted the Belkans after taking our land, now we resisted the Ratians trying to take from us what we rightfully conquered. We will never again let our territory be taken from us. From now on we will fight with even higher spirit and determination."
 UST_new_political_coalition:0 "New Rule To Lead The Nation"
 UST_new_political_coalition_desc:0 "Falangs, made out of nationalists and militarists, were always a minor party in our nation. But after Ratio's trespassing they were the ones who's actions allowed us to not only withstand but also conquer that storm. There is no denying that their actions demand acknowledgement, so it has been decided that the FEJ should join them in a new coalition and unite both parties into one political body."
 UST_army_as_part_of_state:0 "The Army Is A Part Of The State"
 UST_army_as_part_of_state_desc:0 "Rather than a simple tool or weapon wielded by the state, the state and the army should be intertwined into one, promoting militarism and ensuring the military stays among our top priorities."
 UST_ustian_youth:0 "Ustian Youth"
 UST_ustian_youth_desc:0 "Some of the most critical years of a person's life are when they are young. Opening up new programs to involve youth in the state will strengthen the next generation's loyalty to Ustio and help them develop vital skills to benefitting our nation at a young age."
 UST_mandatory_military_training:0 "Mandatory Military Training"
 UST_mandatory_military_training_desc:0 "Given our reputation, there will likely come a day when we will come under attack again by one or more of our neighbors. To prepare for this possibility, we will require all adults in our nation to at least be trained in military operations, to ensure that even if our frontline divisions will fall, the people will carry on their fight."
 UST_forced_nationalisation:0 "Forced Nationalisation"
 UST_forced_nationalisation_desc:0 "The Belkans set an example through their attempted Belkanization programs of Ustio, which saw some success. We will use what they did right and learn from what they did wrong to strengthen our grip on the former Ratian territories."
 UST_expel_the_ratio_people:0 "Expel The Ratian People"
 UST_expel_the_ratio_people_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, many Ratians are refusing assimilation and their terror groups are becoming emboldened by the day as more defect to them. To restore order, we must deport all known Ratian nationals out of Ustio and either force them to move inland, or be sent over the border into Ratio."
 UST_focus_on_the_west:0 "Focus On The West"
 UST_focus_on_the_west_desc:0 "Our former overlord, Belka, has recently begun to resurge in power and very clearly is not looking to continue the 1988 Federal Law Review agreement. War is inevitable, and we must be well prepared for it. We will begin focusing our defense efforts on the western border and developing counters for Belkan tactics."

 UST_national_uni_desc:0 "To further promote education in our nation, the construction of an Ustian National University as the pinnacle of Ustian education and ensuring we have direct control over it will improve the quality of our high-profile jobs over time.

 ### EVENTS ###
 
 ustio.1.t:0 "Offer from Ratio"
 ustio.1.d:0 "Following our recent acquisition of territory from Belka, our eastern neighbor of Ratio has approached us with a deal. The lands of Tyrann and Boikos are primarily Ratian in culture, as they were relatively recently conquered from them by Belka. Even after falling under our control in the Belkan Federal Law Review of 1988, Ratio has never renounced their claim on the lands, however they appear to be far friendlier to us than Belka. They have offered a deal to purchase the lands back from us for a generous price, far exceeding the actual value of the territories. This, combined with several clauses allowing us to move Ustian assets out of the land and into our core areas, and a parnership with our nation for future cooperations. This deal appears to be extremely beneficial for us, as in addition to the obvious monetary benefits, we have had extensive trouble dealing with partisan forces in the area, and as a relatively new nation in the world, the presence of another ally would be greatly valued. The only protest against this deal has come from Franek Dolas, who argues that we have spent extensive resources on the lands, and even if it was under Belkan leadership, many Ustians fought and died to conquer the land. As he argues, the strongest nation will be the one who succeeds, first it was Belka, and when they were proven weak, we rose to that position instead, and if Ratio thinks they should have the land they will need to prove their strength over us to obtain it. Aside from his ramblings, the advisory board is unanimous that this deal should be taken."
 ustio.1.a:0 "We gleefully accept!"
 ustio.1.b:0 "Dolas is right. The stronger nation is the one who deserves the land."
 
 ustio.2.t:0 "Osea Offers Western Land"
 ustio.2.d:0 "We received an interesting transmission from our allies in Osea today, offering us control over our former territories that were not liberated from Belka even after the 1988 Belkan Federal Law Review. It is strange to recieve this offer from a country that does not currently own these territories, however the Oseans revealed that as a part of a trade deal with Belka, the Belkans agreed to withdraw from all other occupied territories and sell the Great Lakes territories to Osea. While we would expect Osea to take these territories and sell them to us, they have not asked for a payment or even claimed the land, and are seemingly just giving it to us for free. The only request they made was to reaffirm our friendship, which we were more than happy to do, although this does make us wonder..."
 ustio.2.a:0 "...Just what are the Oseans planning?"
 
 ustio.3.t:0 "The Return of the West"
 ustio.3.d:0 "Following the Osean's transmission, sure enough, Belka soon retreated their armed forces from Western Ustio, allowing us to move in and take over ownership of the land. This is an unprecedented move and both widens our possibilities and responsibilities greatly. For now, however, Ustians both at home and in these new territories are rejoicing for the union with their brothers, and so soon after our own liberation to. Best of all is that not a single drop of blood was spilled for this. Perhaps when all this is over we can even maintain relations with Belka, as clearly if they are dealing with Osea, perhaps they will deal with us too."
