 ac_news_event.1.t:0 "Belka Sells Territories to Neighbors"
 ac_news_event.1.d:0 "News reports have confirmed that the Belkan Federation has sold large portions of territory to its neighbors in what seems to be a desperate attempt to escape their economic troubles after a deal was offered to them by the Osean government. One commentator noted that Belka, whom has a history of fiercely defending what they consider their home, must be in extremely dire straits to take such a deal. Many Belkans in the newly sold territories are protesting, while other citizens, mostly in Eastern Belka, are celebrating union with many nations that they feel more inclined to. While many Belkans are humiliated at this deal, many Oseans are calling it "progress towards peace.""
 ac_news_event.1.a:0 "We will reclaim those lands, one day."
 ac_news_event.1.b:0 "A good deal!"
 ac_news_event.1.c:0 "Progress towards peace or fuel to the fire?"
 
 ac_news_event.2.t:0 "Ustio Cedes Eastern Lands to Ratio"
 ac_news_event.2.d:0 "The former eastern territories of Ustio, once a part of Belka, and a part of Ratio before that, have been seemingly returned back to the original nation in exchange for Ratio recognizing the new nation and proclaiming support for it. After being conquered from Ratio in the Belkan age of expansion, the territories were added to the state of Ustio, however the culture remained Ratian. With the secession and now territorial growth of Ustio, Ratio seems to have deemed it time to right this historical wrong and reclaim control over these lands. The Ustians seem unhurt by this deal, and all but the hardest nationalists are celebrating the gain of an ally rather than grieving the loss of territory."
 ac_news_event.2.a:0 "Brothers in arms."
 ac_news_event.2.b:0 "Another set of maps outdated."
 
 ac_news_event.3.t:0 "Recta Declares Independence"
 ac_news_event.3.d:0 "Following a long line of disagreements between Rectan regionals and the Gebetian government, it appears that Gebet has allowed Recta to declare its own independence, while still maintaining a close relationship with Gebet itself. A region that has long yearned for independence and a hotbed of socialist movements, Belka's solution to governing this territory was to add it to the Gebetian government in hopes they could control it better, a decision which lasted even after the independence of Gebet after the Belkan Federal Law Review of 1987. Despite the two countries often harboring rival ideologies, Gebetian-Rectan relations have always been strong, something that this new development does not seem to have changed. The new government is reportedly beginning to transform itself along the principles of socialism."
 ac_news_event.3.a:0 "Better than fighting."
 ac_news_event.3.b:0 "We are free!"
 ac_news_event.3.c:0 "Socialists? In Osea?"
 
 ac_news_event.4.t:0 "Great Lakes Resource Development Company Fails"
 ac_news_event.4.d:0 "What first seemed like a step towards peace in Osea has turned out to be a complete failure. The Great Lakes Resource Development Company, a joint excavation company formed by Osea and Belka to extract resources in the recently sold territories, seems to have gone bankrupt in only a few weeks after it's creation. Some speculate that this company was a farce created to sabatoge Belka's economy further, as even minor resource deposits would allow the company to exist for at least a few months. The Osean public has had a small response to this, with small complaints about wasted money and time, many of whom blame Belka for these issues, while Belka's government has fallen further into debt and disrepair, and nationalistic movements throughout the country are beginning to gather immense support, capitalizing off the failure."
 ac_news_event.4.a:0 "Never trust an Osean."
 ac_news_event.4.b:0 "All according to plan."
 ac_news_event.4.c:0 "What's next for Belka?"
 
 ac_news_event.5.t:0 "Far-Right Wins Belkan Elections"
 ac_news_event.5.d:0 "Following two resignations of governments, it's not too much of a surprise that the last remaining party in Belkan politics, the nationalist Democratic Liberal Party, has won a landslide victory against the opposing monarchist coalition, and is now attempting to recover the nation. Many foreign commentators predict that nothing will change and that the complete collapse of Belka is inevitable, while others fear the rise of a nationalistic Belka will threaten peace in Osea and even the world at large. The new administration has promised to take drastic measures to rebuild the country, "without bending to the will of other nations" as the last two allegedly did. Regardless, this presents a drastic change in Belkan leadership from the past governments."
 ac_news_event.5.a:0 "Belka will rise again."
 ac_news_event.5.b:0 "Their people are desperate."
 
 ac_news_event.6.t:0 "Waldemarr Rald Coups Belkan Government"
 ac_news_event.6.d:0 "Yesterday, a number of divisions of the Belkan Army as well as several paramilitary militias seized control of critical Belkan cities and installments, and proclaimed their loyalty to Waldemarr Rald, the leader of the militarist faction of the DLP. Reportedly, Rald was unhappy with the military downsizing done by the DLP to repair the economy, and took advantage of his contacts in the military to orchestrate a coup throughout the country, deposing the other members of the DLP. Rald has outspokenly declared that he will continue to recover the country, while also continuing to build and maintain the military strength of the nation. Responses to this move across the globe are almost universally negative, with many calling Rald a dictator and tyrant."
 ac_news_event.6.a:0 "Those who made Belka weak are finally gone."
 ac_news_event.6.b:0 "Nationalist AND militarist? What next?"
 
 ac_news_event.7.t:0 "The Belkan War"
 ac_news_event.7.d:0 "In a dramatic turn of events, Belkan President Waldemarr Rald has declared war on the nations of Osea, Sapin, Ustio, Recta, Gebet, and FATO, citing the reclaimation of unlawfully occupied territories, and has started offensive maneuvers into all these nations. All of them have denounced Rald, and have formed an alliance known as the Allied Forces, with the goal of defending each other and fighting back the Belkans. Despite Belka's large military prowess, many people are confident that Belka will not last longer than a few months before exhausting their resources, and many more are calling this a "pointless war." Regardless of the outcome, the state of Belka's economy has led many to conclude that Rald's gambit is on borrowed time, and he will need to see quick success if he wishes to continue his reign."
 ac_news_event.7.a:0 "Today is Belka's finest hour."
 ac_news_event.7.b:0 "We will not falter."
 ac_news_event.7.c:0 "The power keg is lit once more."
 
 ac_news_event.8.t:0 "Nuclear Detonations in Belka"
 ac_news_event.8.d:0 "Seven nuclear detonations have been confirmed in Belka this afternoon, in key locations around North Belka and the Waldreich Mountains. Context indicates that these nuclear detonations were done by Belka itself, likely as a last-ditch defensive effort to repel the rapidly advancing Allied Forces throughout their land. At this time it is unknown how many casualties occured as a result of these detonatons, or how many of them are civilian. The world has reacted with shock to this action, with some blaming the Oseans and Allied Forces for pushing Belka to this point, while others condemn the actions of Belka as fanatical and sacrifical, with some even going as far as to call it a domestic terror attack. The world looks on, all of them sharing one single question: What now?"
 ac_news_event.8.a:0 "It's not over yet."
 ac_news_event.8.b:0 "How far will the Belkans go?!"
 
 ac_news_event.9.t:0 "Belka Triumphant"
 ac_news_event.9.d:0 "Following a combination of complete Belkan control over the nations of Ustio, Recta, Gebet, and FATO, Belkan reclamation of lands lost to Osea and Sapin, and finally continued losses and waning popularity have forced the President of Osea to sue for peace with Belka. The terms were heavily one-sided, with Belka regaining all territory originally sold several years ago, in addition to complete control over their neighboring countries. Victory celebrations are widespread across Belka, and rumors of Rald preparing to carve up his new territories are circulating. Suffering its first loss in almost a century, Osea has suffered immense casualties, tanking the President's popularity overnight."
 ac_news_event.9.a:0 "Ave Belka!"
 ac_news_event.9.b:0 "Bitter defeat."
 ac_news_event.9.c:0 "The world has changed overnight."
#This marks the first time the Osean Federation has lost a war in almost a century, and the President has been attempting to salvage the situation as best he can, despite his approval ratings already beginning to plummet. <---- Re-add later if enough space in event
 
 ac_news_event.10.t:0 "Natural Resources Discovered in Ustio"
 ac_news_event.10.d:0 "A recent prospecting company employed by the government of Ustio has reportedly found massive deposits of gold, silver, and other precious metals in the mountains and deserts of the country, located close enough to the surface to be harvested with minimal expense. Land sales have skyrocketed, and the government is scrambling to authorize excavation companies and teams to begin taking advantage of this discovery. While most celebrate this discovery, as it will empower the new country, the Belkan government has claimed these resources belong to Belka, as they were not aware of these resources when Ustio was allowed to secede. The failure of the Great Lakes Resource Development Company fresh in their minds, some are also accusing Osea of having orchestrated the whole thing."
 ac_news_event.10.a:0 "Those were meant to be ours!"

 ac_news_event.11.t:0 "Southern Belka Demilitarizes"
 ac_news_event.11.d:0 "Seemingly from a loss of faith in it's government to continue the war effort, a large number of cities in South and West Belka have formally surrendered, and are allowing Allied troops in without resistance. The ongoing war has put a heavy toll on the people of these lands, and it appears many of them have just simply reached their limit. While North Belka remains resistant, at least for now, cracks in the Belkan nation are showing, and one can only wonder how much time is left before Belka has no choice but to surrender to the invader."
 ac_news_event.11.a:0 "Weak-kneed traitors."
 ac_news_event.11.b:0 "Belka is running out of time."
 
 ac_news_event.12.t:0 "Excalibur Destroyed"
 ac_news_event.12.d:0 "Excalibur, a large experimental chemical laser weapon in Belka designed to shoot down ICBMs, then repurposed to assist in military combat, has been completely and utterly destroyed by a flight of aircraft, rendering it inoperable for the forseeable future. The large laser tower, the product of Belka's intense militarization program, was originally devised and designed for self-defense, allowing Belka to defend itself against missile attacks, however some small modifications allowed it to become an effective area denial tool for use in war. Despite this, it appears that an attack force was able to make it to the structure itself and destroy the facility, negating it's advantage. This is a severe blow to Belka, and some question if this victory will permanately tip the scales in the Allied Forces' favor."
 ac_news_event.12.a:0 "We don't need superweapons to win."
 ac_news_event.12.b:0 "The sword has been pulled from it's stone."

 ac_news_event.18.d:0 "In total unexpectantly, World today got hold of the news that Belka High Command was arrested in almost its entirety by a group of young military officers after supposedly deciding to abandon South Belka and conduct a full retreat behind Waldreich Mountains. Young officers proclaimed that if Belka is to die, it should do it fighting and not by rotting, beaten and forgotten. This information shocked Allied Forced because what was looking like an already won war, with even a peace already in making, will probably now turn into slaughter and grind for every last bit of Belka. Coup was seemingly bloodless except 7 small incidents where Belkan fighters opened fire on their own Heavy Bombers and their escort over Waldreich Mountains. We still have no information on this topic but it was probably just misinformation in Army after a short period of chaos."
