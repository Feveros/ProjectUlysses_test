 ### IDEAS ###
 
 BLK_eco_crisis:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_desc:0 "Our economy is in utter shambles. Unemployment is at record heights, banks are defaulting, companies and individuals are filing for bankruptcy daily, and the value of our money is in freefall. Every industrial field has been grinding to a halt, and if nothing is done it's likely our entire nation will descend into chaos.\n\nTo make matters worse, this has given rise to §RCommunist§! and §RSyndicalist§! groups, who are fully capitalizing off these failures."
 BLK_eco_crisis_2:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_2_desc:0 "Through some desperate measures, we've managed to mitigate the collapse of our economy. Nothing much has changed, but the worsening is slowing down. We must contine though, else these efforts will be for nothing."
 BLK_eco_crisis_3:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_3_desc:0 "We've managed to stall the decline of our economy enough to stop the continued damage. We've sacrificed a lot, and still have a long way to go, but the worst is behind us."
 BLK_eco_crisis_4:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_4_desc:0 "Our reconstruction programs appear to be having moderate success. We've been able to refloat some businesses and industries, and certain programs are recovering, but much of the nation is still in poverty."
 BLK_eco_crisis_5:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_5_desc:0 "We have almost put the crisis behind us. Life is returning to normal, and our last relief programs are working hard to restore our citizens' wellbeing. The long road is finally coming to an end."
 BLK_overspending_for_military:0 "Overspending On Military"
 BLK_overspending_for_military_desc:0 "In attempts to not fall behind the militaries of Osea and our other neighbors, we have poured an overly large amount of our budget into the military. Not only has this crippled our economy and gives the military sizable influence over the entirety of our country, but has also turned our military into a logistical nightmare."
 BLK_chaos_in_the_assembly:0 "Chaos In The Assembly"
 BLK_chaos_in_the_assembly_desc:0 "The National Assembly, our parliament, has been in a state of near-gridlock ever since our last election. The §Bconservative BNCP§!, §Cliberal Wege§!, and §Onationalist DLP§! have failed to pass almost any resolutions, and as a result both our population and government are extremely restless and grow more polarized by the day.\n\nThis chaos has caused a number of politicians from all parties to support a return to an §Gabsolute monarchy§!, hoping it would return stability and order to the country."
 BLK_research_department:0 "Special Military Research Department"
 BLK_research_department_desc:0 "The Belkan Special Military Research Department serves as the link between our scientific, military, and political organizations, and is at the forefront of military technology, both in Belka and the world."
 BLK_echos_of_history:0 "Echoes Of History"
 BLK_echos_of_history_desc:0 "Belka is a land rich with traditions, many of which we trace back to the ancient Belkan Knights, the most prestigious soldiers of the ancient world. We invoke these legends into the way we fight and live."
 
 BLK_echos_elitarism:0 "§BElitism§!"
 BLK_echos_land:0 "§BMilitaristic Spirit§!"

 BLK_air_department:0 "§BAir Forces Branch§!"
 
 BLK_people_leave_idea:0 "Mass Emigrations"
 BLK_people_leave_idea_desc:0 "The lack of jobs and support for the unemployed is causing people to leave Belka in massive groups, causing a shortage of almost any kind of position imaginable."
 BLK_no_money_idea:0 "Run Out Of Money"
 BLK_no_money_idea_desc:0 "Belka's government has gone into full bankruptcy, unable to support itself or get any kind of bailout, causing a complete collapse in the chain of command. No one knows where their next paycheck, if any, will come from."

 ### FOCUSES ###
 BLK_the_crisis_continues:0 "The Crisis Continues"
 BLK_the_crisis_continues_desc:0 "Our nation has been in a severe crisis for several years now, with no end in sight. The longer this drags on, the less likely we will be able to recover. It's time to look at this situation for what it is, and analyze the finer details of it."
 BLK_country_wide_protests:0 "Country Wide Protests"
 BLK_country_wide_protests_desc:0 "The complete collapse of living standards in our country has skyrocketed discontent with our administration, and hundreds of people across the nation are protesting en mass. If we are not careful, we could make things much worse. We will investigate these protests and see how we can alleviate, or at least placate them."
 BLK_economy_in_pieces:0 "Economy Collapsing"
 BLK_economy_in_pieces_desc:0 "It goes without saying that all this trouble originated from the economic stagnation, then recession, which itself originated from poor management of our funds. We need to get perspective on just how bad the damage is, and what methods we can take to fix it."
 BLK_no_work_place:0 "No Work For People"
 BLK_no_work_place_desc:0 "The closing of hundreds of both local and national businesses has laid off millions of people, which is a self-replicating issue in itself as well as causing many more issues. We need to study the scale of this unemployment and get stats on how much we have to work with, and how much time we have left before it becomes unrecoverable."
 BLK_no_money:0 "No Money"
 BLK_no_money_desc:0 "We have hit rock bottom. Our attempted programs to get a scale of the crisis have burned through the last of our resources, and we are now powerless to do anything. We are now forced to resort to desperate measures to keep our entire nation from falling apart."
 BLK_sell_the_land:0 "Sell Off The Belkan Land"
 BLK_sell_the_land_desc:0 "We may have found a way to buy time. Our rivals, the Osean Federation, have offered to purchase a portion of our western territories for a sizable sum of money, allowing us to kickstart some recovery programs. It pains us to take such a humiliating deal with our enemy, but we have no other option."
 BLK_osean_prop:0 "Great Lakes Resource Development Company"
 BLK_osean_prop_desc:0 "The Oseans have expressed interest in a joint resource excavation company focused around the Great Lakes region, which has shown great promise according to them. Their sudden cooperation is somewhat suspicious, but this could be key to restarting our economy."
 BLK_wait_for_profit:0 "Await The Results"
 BLK_wait_for_profit_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Resource Company has gone online, and we have put our remaining resources into it. All we have to do now is wait for the profits from the resource exports. Once that comes in, we can start the recovery process. Perhaps the Oseans aren't so bad after all."
 BLK_dark_times:0 "Future Awaits"
 BLK_dark_times_desc:0 "We are truly in dark times now. Our populace is in open rebellion, we have once again exhausted our resources, and our national pride has been shattered by the Oseans. There is nothing we can do now. Belka is lost."
 
 BLK_dlp_victory:0 "DLP In Power"
 BLK_dlp_victory_desc:0 "At last, nothing stands in Belka's way. The cowardly conservatives simply wished their problems away, too scared to ever take action. The weak-kneed liberals bowed to our greatest enemy, the Oseans, to try and save themselves. We will do what they could not. We will allow Belka to take her rightful place atop the world. To live and thrive, that is what we will accomplish. Rejoice, for Belka is young again."
 BLK_to_save_what_we_can:0 "To Save What We Can"
 BLK_to_save_what_we_can_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures. The previous parties have left Belka in such a state of ruin that we will need to take drastic action to save the nation. However, this will show our people that we will not idly sit by and watch our nation decay, which if they are smart, they will see as worth the cost."
 BLK_downsizing_focus:0 "Downsizing And Downscaling"
 BLK_downsizing_focus_desc:0 "Despite the very obvious downsides, the previous governments continued to spend large amount of maintaining our oversized military. While a powerful military is important, we know that to survive we must spend our resources on developing a strong economic foundation on which to sustain that military."
 BLK_revitalise_civ_eco:0 "Demobilisation And Revitalisation"
 BLK_revitalise_civ_eco_desc:0 "Rather than build completely new factories, tools, and machines for our industry, we have plenty of surplus equipment from our recent downsizing of the military. We can repurpose these into the civilian market to cut some costs of launching and maintaining new programs, allowing us to widen our options of industrial programs."
 BLK_new_workplaces:0 "Public Work Projects"
 BLK_new_workplaces_desc:0 "Many of Belka's old public works have fallen into neglect or disrepair following the economic crisis, or even the budget reorganization before that. Reviving these will raise the people's faith in our government, provide more services to our citizens, and raise their national pride to be Belkan. This will be a crucial step in restoring our image, both at home and across the world."
 BLK_put_people_to_work:0 "Emigrants, Unemployed And Prisoners"
 BLK_put_people_to_work_desc:0 "The economic crash has caused mass layoffs and unemployment, grinding our industry to a halt. This is too big an issue to resolve right now, however some members of our administration have developed an idea to provide some easy, cheap labor to get the ball rolling."
 BLK_seeds_of_industry:0 "Manipulation, Fabrication And Other Market Strategies"
 BLK_seeds_of_industry_desc:0 "The economic market is a ruthless battleground, and if we wish to harness it to our advantage we must be willing to use any means necessary to control it, even means which might not be well liked. It's all for the greater good, anyway."
 BLK_dev_south_belka:0 "Develop South Belka"
 BLK_dev_south_belka_desc:0 "South Belka is a region of our nation which has not had significant development, however there is plenty of space for new buildings there. We will develop this land specifically, as it will provide the greatest amount of possibilities for further development."
 BLK_dev_heart_of_the_nation:0 "Develop Heart Of The Nation"
 BLK_dev_heart_of_the_nation_desc:0 "The north of Belka is well defended and central to our nation, as well as we can build off of existing infrastructure, we will continue developments here as it will give us the quickest return on investment as well as serve our nation for a long time to come."
 BLK_end_of_the_chain:0 "Domestic Stability"
 BLK_end_of_the_chain_desc:0 "Through some quick thinking, we've managed to stem the tide of the crisis and bring some badly needed relief to our people. From here, we can start planning our next moves to put this nightmare behind us."
 BLK_fuel_reconstruction:0 "To Fuel Our Reconstruction"
 BLK_fuel_reconstruction_desc:0 "Our own ability to recover has been crippled. If we are to survive this, as painful as it is, we will need to get help from outside nations. If we can scrounge up whatever resources we have and set a trading presence again, we will be able to attract international businesses to our borders once again."
 BLK_resources:0 "Develop Resources Excavation"
 BLK_resources_desc:0 "We've set up a nice foothold to base our international platform on, but this will not suffice. We must contine excavation efforts to increase the amount of resources we can export to other nations and create further demand."
 BLK_fuel_nationalisation:0 "Nationalise Remains Of "Crescens OIL""
 BLK_fuel_nationalisation_desc:0 "Crescens OIL was an offshore oil excavation company based off our northern coast which provided the majority of the oil to Belka. After being hit hard by the economic crisis and now with Crescens being owned by Osea, not much remains of this company. If we nationalize it, we can save what's left of it, as well as be able to extract further oil with no strings attached."
 BLK_tools_and_machinery:0 "Buy New Tools And Machinery"
 BLK_tools_and_machinery_desc:0 "Belka's industrial foundation hasn't been updated or even really analyzed since the beginning of the crisis, and as a result our tools are likely one or more generations out of date. If we empower our factories through modernizing their tools, we will see efficiency rise in factories all across the nation, not limited to a specific area, group, or company."
 BLK_focus_our_eco:0 "Focus Our Economic Efforts"
 BLK_focus_our_eco_desc:0 "Our economic policies and style of management are very old and suited to a much earlier era, and likely is not nearly as efficient as some of our neighbors. Reshuffling management and reforming laws and quotas to fit this will let our main factories run like a well oiled machine again."
 BLK_expand_rails:0 "Expand National Rail System"
 BLK_expand_rails_desc:0 "Aside from incrasing our production capabilities, we need to make sure that resources and goods can be easily transported throughout our nation. In the old administration, deliveries could be lost or delayed rather easily, however by standardizing all railways and expanding the federal rail system we can coordinate transportation much more efficiently than ever before."
 BLK_start_of_the_chain:0 "Investment Opportunities"
 BLK_start_of_the_chain_desc:0 "With our foreign trade status recovering, investors are seeing Belka as a land of opportunity, and as each one joins in, the prospect becomes more and more enticing, starting a exponential chain of investments. With this, we can improve our domestic industry until we're back on our feet."
 
 BLK_party_disagreements:0 "Party Disagreements"
 BLK_party_disagreements_desc:0 "Our recent choices in how to allow our economy to recover has upset a number of people in our party, most notably the militarists, who are upset with our cuts of their budget. These voices have grown louder over time, and are already threatening to disrupt our party's control."
 BLK_talks_in_shadows:0 "Talks In Shadows"
 BLK_talks_in_shadows_desc:0 "Surprisingly, all the dissenting politicians and officials have quieted down, almost overnight. While this does make affairs easier for us, we can't help but shake the feeling that something suspicious is going on..."
 BLK_pull_the_trigger:0 "Pull The Trigger"
 BLK_pull_the_trigger_desc:0 "The time has come. The pacifist devils have crippled our military, the only thing we have, allowing foreign influence to creep in. We will clean house of these wolves, and restore Belka's strength before it is too late."
 BLK_nationalism_unleashed:0 "Nationalism Unleashed"
 BLK_nationalism_unleashed_desc:0 "There is no higher honor than to be a Belkan. Our people have forgotten this, and have gotten hung up on petty issues in our nation, tearing each other apart. We must remind them of who they are, and what it truly means to be Belkan."
 BLK_taking_off_the_kid_gloves:0 "Taking Off The Kid Gloves"
 BLK_taking_off_the_kid_gloves_desc:0 "Too many politicians are afraid of other nations, and strive to placate them to save their own skin. Not ours. We are not afraid to show the world our strength. They have more reason to fear us than we do to fear them."
 
 BLK_cult_of_belka:0 "The Cult Of Belka"
 BLK_cult_of_belka_desc:0 "What is Belka? A nation, some might say. But no. Nor is it a place, a government, or even a people. Belka is an idea. A concept, which we all must work towards creating. We will spread the word far and wide, that every citizen must do their part to reveal what Belka is in it's truest form."
 BLK_police_state:0 "Enact Martial Law"
 BLK_police_state_desc:0 "Although we have control for now, it is inevitable that misguided people will come to oppose us. Enacting martial law will give us more control over the nation, and will severely stunt oppposition efforts to foil our recovery."
 BLK_autarky:0 "Autarky Doctrine"
 BLK_autarky_desc:0 "If there is anything that the previous governments' experiences with trading with other nations has proved, is that they cannot be trusted. Why should we give them any resources when we know they will be used against us? From now on, all of Belka's resources belong to Belka, not any other nation."
 BLK_spirit_of_belkan_militarism:0 "An Army With A State"
 BLK_spirit_of_belkan_militarism_desc:0 "Going back all the way to the ancient Belkan Knights, Belka's existence has always been inseperable from the strength of it's military. We must think less of the government as the controller of the military, and more of a guider of the military. Most nations are states with armies, Belka is an army with a state."
 BLK_fortify_the_west:0 "Fortify The East"
 BLK_fortify_the_west_desc:0 "After the conservatives foolishly allowed parts of our nation to secede, they have now taken up arms against us. We will bring these lands back into their rightful place, but first we must prepare. Fortifying our border with them will give us a safe place to strike from."
 BLK_new_blood:0 "New Blood In The Lidership"
 BLK_new_blood_desc:0 "After going through this many divisions, our government is rather understaffed. Bringing in new, promising, and loyal people will strengthen our position, and help pave the way to Belka's future."
 BLK_women_in_industry:0 "Women In The Workforce"
 BLK_women_in_industry_desc:0 "It is wrong for us to put women onto the battlefield, endangering them. A much safer option that still allows women to contribute to our nation is by opening up industry positions for them, further bolstering our industrial capabilites."
 BLK_women_in_army:0 "Conscription Without Exception"
 BLK_women_in_army_desc:0 "Anyone who can hold a gun and follow orders is fit to serve in our army. The opportunity to fight for Belka is among the highest honor ever dreamed of, and it would be wrong to prevent anyone from partaking in it."
 BLK_gott_mit_uns:0 "Gott Mit Uns"
 BLK_gott_mit_uns_desc:0 "To thrive, every aspect of Belka must be united. We cannot allow for a multitude of faiths to control our people, there must be one truth preached to all our people, reminding them of our single united purpose. "
 BLK_excalibur:0 "Excalibur Project"
 BLK_excalibur_desc:0 "Excalibur, a long-range anti-missile laser defense system, has been in development for just over a decade now. It was nearly finished when the crisis occured and funding was cut. We will finish this program and protect our skies from missile attacks."
 BLK_form_bs:0 "Form BSF"
 BLK_form_bs_desc:0 "The Belkan Special Forces, elite divisions comprised of the best of the best, have been suggested by many people in the past, however were never successfully created. We will finally create them, serving as both a elite spearhead division for difficult operations, and as a symbol of Belka's might to the world."
 BLK_avalon:0 "Avalon Dam Project"
 BLK_avalon_desc:0 "Disguised as a simple hydroelectric dam, Avalon Dam is a high-tech testing facility as well as a launch site for ICBMs. Much like our other project, it was near completion when funding was cut. We will finish the facility and use it to continue research and development of cutting-edge military technology, before the lack of care allows someone to discover it's true purpose."
 BLK_drill_the_army:0 "Loyalty Above All"
 BLK_drill_the_army_desc:0 "After filling our ranks, we need to instill a sense of duty in our new recruits. All soldiers, politicians, workers, everyone, will be taught from a young age that loyalty to Belka is the utmost priority. Nothing else comes close."
 BLK_unemployment:0 "Crush The Unemployment"
 BLK_unemployment_desc:0 "Many people in our nation are adrift, lacking cause or purpose, without any drive. Conscripting anyone without a job into the army will give them a purpose and a sense of duty, as well as give them a productive use to our nation."
 BLK_militarise_civilian_infr:0 "Militarise Civilian Infrastructure"
 BLK_militarise_civilian_infr_desc:0 "Many people are showing resistance to our new consription policy. We will show them that in Belka, the military is not just a force, it is a way of life. We will bring the military into all aspects of the civilian sector, showing them they cannot simply escape it."
 BLK_new_supply_dep:0 "Expand Supply Network"
 BLK_new_supply_dep_desc:0 "Our conscription policy has forced many people into the military, some of whom don't seem to want to be there. Rather than force them to fight against their will, we will open up opportunities for them to help in supplying the frontline, putting them in far less danger while still making use from them."
 BLK_overspending_on_military:0 "Fuel The Engines"
 BLK_overspending_on_military_desc:0 "The pacifists and other parties described the previous government as "overspending" on the military. The truth is, they were not spending enough on it. The military is the spirit and strength of Belka, and no price is high enough to keep it strong. We will restore the budget to it's original state, empowering the military once again."
 BLK_military_industrial_complex:0 "Reawake Belkan Military Industrial Complex"
 BLK_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "The military and industrial companies are closely related to each other, and increasing their cooperation is a guranteed way to keep both strong and stable. Bringing the two together again will allow us to power our army like never before."
 BLK_quantity:0 "Quantity Ideas"
 BLK_quantity_desc:0 "The enemy nations seek to control Belka's people. If every man, woman and child in Belka were to fight back, not only would they prove a near impossible enemy to defeat, but the lack of controllable people would render any invasion pointless, giving us unique power over our enemies. We will allow anyone who wishes to serve the ability to, arming the masses."
 BLK_quantity_2:0 "Use The Unusable"
 BLK_quantity_2_desc:0 "Even those who might be overlooked by society have a purpose to us. Criminals have signed away their rights, and as a result there is no harm in us placing them on the frontlines. The promise of freedom for service will prevent them from rebelling, as well as a constant watch on their actions."
 BLK_quality:0 "Quality Ideas"
 BLK_quality_desc:0 "Belkan knights were the pride of the ancient world for their discipline and courage. Rather than carelessly throw waves of men at the enemy, we will train and drill our soldiers to the core, reminding them of the legacy they carry They will rival their ancient counterparts in their strength and glory."
 BLK_quality_2:0 "Belkan Assault Tactics"
 BLK_quality_2_desc:0 "Good doctrine is just as critical to success as good soliders are. Our old doctrines are getting rather outdated, and as a result we may suffer against advanced foes. Reforming our doctrine and keeping it fresh in our soldiers' minds will keep them alive, and strengthen their efficiency."
 BLK_infantry_focus:0 "The Backbone Of The Army"
 BLK_infantry_focus_desc:0 "No army in history ever had success from neglecting it's infantry. The most versatile of any combat unit devised, if our army is mostly composed of infantry it makes sense to devote the most investments into the infantry as well."
 BLK_mech:0 "Develop The Support Core"
 BLK_mech_desc:0 "Anyone can raise a massive army of soldiers, but keeping those soldiers supplied, accounted for, and well prepared in the midst of combat is a much more difficult task. We will invest into developing support for our infantry so that they can fight at their best at all times."
 BLK_tank_focus:0 "To Smash Through"
 BLK_tank_focus_desc:0 "Tanks have proven their worth as the new cavalry, using quick, decisive strikes to disrupt and confuse the enemy. Improving our tank batallions will allow us to slice through enemy infantry with deadly precision, reminiscient of the old Belkan cavalry."
 BLK_armor:0 "Modernise Old Components"
 BLK_armor_desc:0 "Many wars have been fought on our soil, and as such we have a lot of old components lying around. Rather than building new ones from the ground up, analyzing and reusing old designs will let us improve our current ones much faster than we could otherwise."
 BLK_new_weapons:0 "Expand Weapons Research Groups"
 BLK_new_weapons_desc:0 "No single weapon can be left behind and expected to not be outpaced. Development of every single weapon we use must be contined to keep our army a cut above the rest of the world. Expanding our research budget and making individual groups for each weapon will keep it proceeding smoothly."
 BLK_tip_spear:0 "Leopard Project"
 BLK_tip_spear_desc:0 "In tanks, a balance between speed, power, and armor has always been a struggle. The Leopard Project seeks to find the perfect hybrid between these traits to create a new standard of tank."
 BLK_war_games:0 "War Games"
 BLK_war_games_desc:0 "With our army updated and improving, we will run a series of war games and studies to further improve our capabilities, as well as get our soldiers ready for the real thing."
 BLK_secure_fuel:0 "Secure Black Gold"
 BLK_secure_fuel_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of our war machine, and making sure we have enough is critical. Any industry that produces or processes oil must be taken to allow us to keep our nation safe."
 BLK_osean_front:0 "Prepare Osean Front"
 BLK_osean_front_desc:0 "Osea, our longtime rival, has humiliated us by taking our land and taking advantage of us. We will not stand for this humiliation. We will reclaim what is ours soon, but until then we must prepare for the coming conflict."
 BLK_contest_lakes:0 "Contest The Great Lakes"
 BLK_contest_lakes_desc:0 "Securing control of the Great Lakes would allow us to strike into the gateway to Osea proper, forcing them to pull back and giving us an advantage. It will not be easy though, as Osea currently posesses a greater navy than ours and holds more influence over the lakes than we do."
 BLK_dig_in:0 "Let Them Come"
 BLK_dig_in_desc:0 "Osea's main weakness is that any costly war will hurt the image of it's political party, meaning they will not commit to an offensive unless there is a low risk to it. We can exploit this by fortifying ourselves at the border, which Osea will be either forced to respond with a costly push, souring their public support for the war, or remain defensive, allowing us to pick them off at the edges until we can force them to accept our terms."
 BLK_naval_bomb:0 "To Counter Osean Numbers"
 BLK_naval_bomb_desc:0 "Osea's massive fleet will be an extremely difficult opponent to topple. Rather than fight them in decisive battle, attacks from naval aircraft will likely be much cheaper and harass their fleet constantly, draining their resources to fight effectively."
 BLK_aa_air_ports:0 "Construct Aerial Infrastructure"
 BLK_aa_air_ports_desc:0 "In the war against Osea, no doubt will aerial combat prove critical, just as it has in the past. Constructing additional bases and support networks for aircraft should give us an edge against the Oseans in the air war."
 BLK_bunkers_lakes:0 "Schayne Line"
 BLK_bunkers_lakes_desc:0 "It is imperative that the Oseans and our eastern enemies cannot join together to combine armies. The Schayne Line is a proposed line of defenses across our southern tip that should serve as a strong defensive on both sides, making any push to unite the two fronts a highly difficult undertaking."
 BLK_build_up_navy:0 "Plan Z"
 BLK_build_up_navy_desc:0 "Although we may not be able to meet Osea's fleet power, our own navy is nowhere near powerful enough to fight back the Oseans, even with all the support. In the time we have left, building up our navy as much as possible should give us a fighting chance against them."
 BLK_scrap_the_navy:0 "Scrap The Navy"
 BLK_scrap_the_navy_desc:0 "The Belkan Navy has never been anything special, and seeing as there really isn't any use for it in the coming conflict, we may as well be better off scrapping it and using the materials to develop our ground forces."
 BLK_south_belka_munitions_monopoly:0 "South Belka Munitions"
 BLK_south_belka_munitions_monopoly_desc:0 "The South Belka Munitions Factory, at the foot of the Waldreich Mountains, has long been a world leader in weapons and aircraft research and development. Managing to survive the crisis, boosting their industries will give our airforce a much needed bolstering."
 BLK_to_cover_the_skyes:0 "To Cover The Skies"
 BLK_to_cover_the_skyes_desc:0 "fsdfsdfdsfdsfdsfdsfdsdsfdsfdsfdsfdsfdsfsfsfdsfsdfdfsfsdffdsf"
 BLK_crown_jewel:0 "The Crown Jewel"
 BLK_crown_jewel_desc:0 "Ever since it's inception, the Belkan Air Force has been the pride of our nation. The first of it's kind, the Belkan Air Force was created in 1907 during the Osean War. Compared to the Belkan Knights of old, our air force dutifully takes each task with pride and honor, setting a precedence for air forces across the globe."
 BLK_keep_skies_clear:0 "Focus On Superiority"
 BLK_keep_skies_clear_desc:0 "Air superiority has been the main job of our air force ever since it's first days. Rather than being tied to the ground, our fighters fly best when they have no goal except to down the enemy by any means necessary, indirectly keeping our ground troops safe from any interference."
 BLK_fighter:0 "Keep Skies Clear"
 BLK_fighter_desc:0 "Routine patrols and large formation flying of our air force will ensure they are always ready for a fight and never caught off guard by enemy attacks. With complete air dominance, our ground troops will have an easy time pushing through the enemy lines."
 BLK_blast_them_to_kingdom_come:0 "Focus On Support"
 BLK_blast_them_to_kingdom_come_desc:0 "Cooperation between branches is important to victory, and as a result of this our air force's main job should be to assist the ground units with their objectives.

 ### EVENTS ###
 
 belka.1.t:0 "Nation In Pieces"
 belka.1.d:0 "Our nation is in pain. The continued overspending on military has wrecked our economy, which in turn has caused businesses to downsize, laying off workers, making them spend less, further drying up economic growth, causing company after company to close their doors. Without the goods and services offered by many of these companies, it has gotten harder and harder for our citizens to source food, pay bills, or provide for their families. This, in turn, has caused drastically increased radicalization and polarization of our populace, who turn to radical idealisms as their only hope of change. Even worse, now after the state of our nation being this way for a while, our resources in the government are beginning to run thin."
 belka.1.a:0 "God Save Belka."
 
 belka.2.t:0 "People On The Streets"
 belka.2.d:0 "The scope of the protests is far greater than we ever imagined. Nearly every day has some kind of major protest happening somewhere in our country, and crimes have also seen exponential growth compared to when this all began. Masses of people are calling for all sorts of demands, from more reform programs all the way to calls for outright revolution. The silver lining in this is that the sheer mass of protesters makes them unable to unite or organize effectively, making them less of a threat than a organized group. Regardless, this will only buy us some time, as if we continue to leave this issue unresolved they will no doubt find a way to organize."
 belka.2.a:0 "They just need to wait a little longer."
 
 belka.3.t:0 "Economy Long Gone"
 belka.3.d:0 "Our economy has had negative growth for over a year now, and the effects are extremely obvious. The vast majority of our nation lives below the poverty line, as the middle class has been all but obliterated. More than half of the small businesses in the country have closed, and about a third of the large businesses went bankrupt or were bought out. International companies and investors saw the writing on the wall long ago and have left for greener pastures, meaning there's no external group we can use to leverage ourselves back onto our feet. Worst of all, now our own funds in the government have begun to dry up, and we've had to downsize our own government and print larger amounts of currency to offset our expenses. However, even that is wearing thin and the inflation is devaluing our money faster than we can print enough to compensate it."
 belka.3.a:0 "We just have to keep printing."
 
 belka.4.t:0 "Mass Exodus"
 belka.4.d:0 "Unemployment is only the tip of the iceberg. Workers, scientists, doctors, lawyers, even our own officials are emigrating to other countries to find work, and at an alarming rate. The lack of job opportunities in Belka is causing workers to look elsewhere, even outside their home country, to provide for their families. Some are even taking their families with them. Houses run empty and border checkpoints are crowded as people scramble to exit the country. Not only have we lost our workforce, but we will be unable to recover them if we cannot stop this outflow of people. If this keeps up, there won't even be a Belka to revive."
 belka.4.a:0 "Close the borders!"
 
 belka.5.t:0 "Complete Collapse"
 belka.5.d:0 "It appears, ironically, our last efforts to take inventory on the crisis pushed us over the tipping point. Our budget this month was unable to meet the expenses, and as a result we, as a nation, are in complete bankruptcy. As our officials find out, many are simply getting up and leaving. We are completely powerless and at the whims of whatever the future brings. The only influence we have is off goodwill alone, and that will not get us far. The future is dark."
 belka.5.a:0 "Just when we were getting started."
 
 belka.6.t:0 "Government Falls Apart"
 belka.6.d:0 "The word is out. The jig is up. Everyone knows about the state of the government, and almost everyone in any position of power has either been forced out or simply walked out. Belka is in a state of anarchy. It is impossible to even tell what is happening in the country because all sources of information we could use is gone or takes orders from someone new now. Dinsmark is empty."
 belka.6.a:0 "What will become of us?"
 
 belka.7.t:0 "New Elections, New Rule"
 belka.7.d:0 "After the collapse of the BCNP's administration, an emergency election was called by the Alternative Wege to regain control of the government. Unsurprisingly, they came out on top, with the BNCP scattered between the DLP, Wege itself, and the rest joining the monarchist movement. With the liberals now in power and promising to fix the mistakes of the past no matter how difficult it may be, a sliver of hope has returned that new leaders may bring about change."
 belka.7.a:0 "Time to sort this mess out."
 
 belka.8.t:0 "Osean Proposition"
 belka.8.d:0 "Our longtime rivals, the Osean Federation, have approached us with an interesting offer. In return for giving several of our eastern territories to the neighboring countries, and selling a portion of the Great Lakes to Osea itself, the Oseans will pay us a rather high sum of money, giving us the ability to start some recovery programs. Osea has even expressed that they would be willing to lease many of the resources in the area to us through a joint resource excavation company. Some in the government are suspicious of this deal, that it unlike Osea to offer us such a deal without a clear benefit to them, but others are hopeful that it could be the beginning of a new era of cooperation between our nations, as well as our lifeline to save our nation. It is a rather humiliating deal to take, but what other choice do we have?"
 belka.8.a:0 "Better to lose a part of our nation than lose the whole nation."
 
 belka.9.t:0 "Selling Of The Land"
 belka.9.d:0 "With all the paperwork in place, we've agreed to the Oseans' proposal and are preparing to remove our forces from the land. The transactions have been made and we now have enough money to get a few programs going. For their cooperation, [BLK.GetLeader] has suggested we take the Oseans up on their joint resource company offer, something that will give us a reliable income from which to rebuild the rest of our country off of."
 belka.9.a:0 "The best thing this deal gave us was hope."
 
 belka.10.t:0 "GLRDC Goes Life"
 belka.10.d:0 "The Great Lakes Resource Development Company opened up today, marking our second cooperation with the Oseans. Early reports they showed us show promising levels of resources in the area, meaning this will likely be a very lucrative deal. Digging has begun and we've invested more of our money into the program to see a profit as quickly as we can. Things are looking up for us, we may just be able to refloat our economy with this."
 belka.10.a:0 "Maybe the Oseans aren't so bad after all."
 
 belka.11.t:0 "The Results Are In"
 belka.11.d:0 "They lied to us. \n\n The Oseans lied to us about the resources. There weren't even any to begin with in that area. To add insult to injury, we're getting reports in the eastern countries that the territories we sold have plentiful resources in them, that now those countries are exploiting to their full potential. We are now down almost all the money we got from the original deal, and now there does not appear to be any sort of tool or program we can use to save ourselves."
 belka.11.a:0 "We just can't catch a break."
 
 belka.12.t:0 "Total Anarchy"
 belka.12.d:0 "After the news of the Osean scam got out, the public has been whirled back into a frenzy, and our attempts at damage control seem to have completely failed. We've run out of money again, and now the [BLK.GetRulingParty] is seeing mass defections to the communists and monarchists. The public is completely uncontrollable and the nation is in complete anarchy."
 belka.12.a:0 "What can even be done at this point?"
 
 belka.13.t:0 "New Power At The Top"
 belka.13.d:0 "Over the past few days, an intense battle between the DLP and the monarchists ensued across the country, with the DLP now the undisputed dominant power in the country. With the DLP's support in the military assisting them, they have secured control over all apparatuses of state and now are the new leaders of the country, with most of the opposition imprisoned or jailed. With it's third government in the last few months, it remains to be seen if the DLP will solve any of the issues plaguing the country."
 belka.13.a:0 "Nothing will stand in our way."
 
 belka_dlp.1.t:0 "Many People, One Nation, One Goal"
 belka_dlp.1.d:0 "Belka has been wounded, not just by her enemies but also her own supposed leaders, each of whom pulled her apart seeking their own goals. The failiures of the previous governments showed they were not fit to lead Belka. Now it is our turn. We will unite the people and raise Belka from the ashes, ascendent to the top of the world. With no one left to stand in our way, the DLP will restore Belka to it's former glory and beyond. We have much to do, and the people's patience is thin because of the past, so we must waste no time in getting to work. Many of our members have already put forward ideas to start our recovery, which will provide us with a head start on our recovery."
 belka_dlp.1.a:0 "Belka will rise again."
 
 belka_dlp.2.t:0 "The 2 Year Plan"
 belka_dlp.2.d:0 "After intense discussion, we have arrived at a conclusion on how to start our reconstruction. While it is true that the military is all we have left and is necessary for our self-preservation, however this is exactly what we will use to our advantage. Converting a large amount of our military into civilan equipment will allow us to start economic growth without many funds to go off of, and we have plenty of military equipment to use. This has upset the militarist faction of our government, but with all likelihood they will come around when our economy recovers, which from there we can expand the military once again."
 belka_dlp.2.a:0 "We must use what we have."
 
 belka_dlp.3.t:0 "Magic Of Bureaucracy"
 belka_dlp.3.d:0 "Through some decisive means, we've found a way to get back at those wretched Oseans. We still technically have a share in the Great Lakes Resource Development Company, but who said we have to use it for that purpose? Using some underhanded methods and pulling strings, we've managed to convert some of the resources used in that project to produce some industry for our own benefit. This will only work for so long before either the Oseans find out and shut down the company, or the company itself dries up, but it's a nice boost, and one that sticks it to the Oseans."
 belka_dlp.3.a:0 "Revenge will come one day. But this is nice."
 
 belka_dlp.4.t:0 "Harsh Countermeasures"
 belka_dlp.4.d:0 "Getting jobs for the unemployed is a rather large task, however a mitigation we can use to still get some usable labor is by introducing forced labor and community service for prisoners in our nation. To bolster these numbers, we have criminalized emigration and remaining unemployed, which should hopefully give us an edge against unemployment, at the cost of some public opinion."
 belka_dlp.4.a:0 "It's voluntary, because you voluntarily committed a crime!"
 
 belka_dlp.5.t:0 "Regulate Trade Policy"
 belka_dlp.5.d:0 "To recover our economy, we'll need to prompt trade with other nations, but we need to make sure we're gaining a strong profit from it. Rather than allow companies to do free business, we'll make sure that any trade goes through us before it is approved, allowing us to take a cut of the sale, letting us improve the economy itself. With any luck, this process will repeat exponentially, encouraging investors despite the tax of our government on their transactions."
 belka_dlp.5.a:0 "A slice for me and a slice for you."
 
 ##########
 
 belka_dlp_coup.1.t:0 "Clashes Within The Party"
 belka_dlp_coup.1.d:0 "We always expected opposition, at least from the public, and from within our own party to an extent, but we didn't expect it to be around this long. We've begun a number of recovery programs and are already seeing the first fruits of recovery, and yet the militarist faction of our government led by Waldemarr Rald has only dissented louder and louder with each reform that we make, cutting into the military's budget. Unfortunately for us, many of the close-minded officers and generals in the Belkan Armed Forces are seeing these budget cuts as attacks on their livelihood and siding with Rald. It's begun to affect our ability to decision-make, meaning we'll likely need to find a way to please Rald and his militarists."
 belka_dlp_coup.1.a:0 "Can't you just be patient?"
 
 belka_dlp_coup.2.t:0 "Support In The Military"
 belka_dlp_coup.2.d:0 "Almost as soon as we began discussing possible resolutions with Rald, he seems to have disappeared, as well as most of his supporters. We're unsure if they're plotting something, are attempting to force our cabinet into stasis by not meeting the seat count, or if they simply gave up, but in any case it seems the issue resolved itself. Worryingly, many of the heads of the Armed Forces have come forward announcing support for Rald, but despite this outflow of support he has yet to make any appearances."
 belka_dlp_coup.2.a:0 "Back to business."
 
 belka_dlp_coup.3.t:0 "The Coup"
 belka_dlp_coup.3.d:0 "Early yesterday morning, during a regular meeting between Lehmann and several members of the Assembly, a division of the Belkan Army stormed the Dinsmark Parliment Building, killing or capturing all the security forces and the politicians themselves. Over the next 24 hours, similar attacks were carried out all across Belkan government buildings with large success, at which point Rald has come forward announcing that a large number of members of the incumbent government were intentionally weaking Belka with the intention of allowing an Osean invasion, and that he has rounded up most of these "traitors" and will be replacing Berthold Lehmann as the head of government. While not many people believe this story, Rald's grip on the military prevents any organized opposition to his new regime."
 belka_dlp_coup.3.a:0 "Third time's the charm?"
 
 belka_dlp_coup.4.t:0 "Ein Volk, Ein Nation, Ein Ziel!"
 belka_dlp_coup.4.d:0 "President Rald held a public speech today, calling for the Belkan people to put aside their differences and remember that they are, above all else, Belkans, and that is what matters. Nationalism has always been high after the Osean scam in the Great Lakes, and it seems Rald is capitalizing off this, uniting the people off their nationality. This has alarmed several nations around us, mostly Osea and our former member nations, but domestically this speech has seen Rald's approval ratings increase greatly."
 belka_dlp_coup.4.a:0 "Belka must be one if she is to survive."
 
 belka_dlp_coup.5.t:0 "Total War"
 belka_dlp_coup.5.d:0 "The humliation and shame inflicted on us not just by Osea, but also the foolish conservatives who allowed Belkan territory to secede in the 1987 Federal Law Review, cannot be allowed to stand. Waldemarr Rald held a meeting with his cabinet today promising an immenent revenge war against Osea and the former states, reclaiming lost Belkan territory, as soon as the military is restored back to it's former level. While he has not gone public with this information, he has constantly blamed Osea and the other nations for poisoning Belka, and promises citizens that things will be made right. Rald promises to his cabinet a state of "total war," as he describes it: "To wage war with all tools, methods, resources, and weapons that you have at your disposal, to fight tooth and nail with everything you have until victory or annhilation.""
