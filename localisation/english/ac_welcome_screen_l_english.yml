Ace Combat is a flight action game series developed by the Project Aces team of Bandai Namco, in which the player controls an ace pilot flying both real and fictional aircraft for any number of nations, alliances, or even companies, fighting a often one-sided fight until the player character enters the scene, and promptly turns the tide against the antagonists, whom are often equipped with reality-defying superweapons and high-tech futuristic technology.\n\n The universe most mainline Ace Combat games take place in, called "Strangereal," features allegorical countries to those in our own universe, in ways you will likely see in this mod. We highly encourage players of this mod to check out the Ace Combat series of games if they have not done so before.\n\n We are not sponsored or endorsed by Project Aces or Bandai Namco in any way, and are merely fans of the series. While following canon is our primarily goal in developing this mod, there is not enough canon information available to create a HOI4 mod that would be enjoyable, so as such we have had to add our own interpretations, additions, and creations into some aspects of this mod to allow for players to enjoy themselves. Please do not use the content in this mod as examples or evidence of canon materials. For all canon purposes, consider this mod's universe separate from that of the strictly canon Ace Combat.\n With all this said, please enjoy Project Ulysses.\n\n\n-Project Ulysses Development Team"
