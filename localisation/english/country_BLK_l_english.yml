 BLK_grunder_air_designer:0 "South Belka Munitions"
 BLK_south_belka_munitions_air_designer_trait:0 "Belkan Aircraft Designer"
 
 BLK_eco_crisis:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_desc:0 "Our economy is in utter shambles. Unemployment is at record heights, banks are defaulting, companies and individuals are filing for bankruptcy daily, and the value of our currency is in freefall. Every industrial field has been grinding to a halt, and if nothing is done it's likely our entire nation will descend into chaos.\n\nTo make matters worse, this has given rise to §RCommunist§! and §RSyndicalist§! groups, who are fully capitalizing off these failures."
 BLK_eco_crisis_2:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_2_desc:0 "Through some desperate measures, we've managed to mitigate the collapse of our economy. Nothing much has changed, but the worsening is slowing down. We must contine though, else these efforts will be for nothing."
 BLK_eco_crisis_3:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_3_desc:0 "We've managed to stall the decline of our economy enough to stop the continued damage. We've sacrificed a lot, and still have a long way to go, but the worst is behind us."
 BLK_eco_crisis_4:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_4_desc:0 "Our reconstruction programs appear to be having moderate success. We've been able to refloat some businesses and industries, and certain programs are recovering, but much of the nation is still in poverty."
 BLK_eco_crisis_5:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_5_desc:0 "We have almost put the crisis behind us. Life is returning to normal, and our last relief programs are working hard to restore our citizens' wellbeing. The long road is finally coming to an end."
 BLK_overspending_for_military:0 "Overspending On Military"
 BLK_overspending_for_military_desc:0 "In attempt to not fall behind the militaries of Osea and our other neighbors, we have poured an overly large amount of our budget into the military. Not only has this crippled our economy and gives the military sizable influence over the entirety of our country, but has also turned our military into a logistical nightmare."
 BLK_chaos_in_the_assembly:0 "Chaos In The Assembly"
 BLK_chaos_in_the_assembly_desc:0 "The National Assembly, our parliament, has been in a state of near-gridlock ever since our last election. The §Bconservative BNCP§!, §Cliberal Wege§!, and §Onationalist DLP§! have failed to pass almost any resolution, and as a result both our population and government are extremely restless and grow more polarized by the day.\n\nThis chaos has caused a number of politicians from all parties to support a return to an §Gabsolute monarchy§!, hoping it would return stability and order to the country."
 BLK_research_department:0 "Special Military Research Department"
 BLK_research_department_desc:0 "The Belkan Special Military Research Department serves as the link between our scientific, military, and political organizations, and is at the forefront of military technology, both in Belka and the world."
 BLK_echos_of_history:0 "Echoes Of History"
 BLK_echos_of_history_desc:0 "Belka is a land rich with traditions, many of which we trace back to the ancient Belkan Knights, the most prestigious soldiers of the ancient world. We invoke these legends into the way we fight and live."

 BLK_air_department:0 "§BAir Forces Branch§!"
 
 BLK_people_leave_idea:0 "Mass Emigrations"
 BLK_people_leave_idea_desc:0 "The lack of jobs and support for the unemployed is causing people to leave Belka in massive groups, causing a shortage of almost any kind of position imaginable."
 BLK_no_money_idea:0 "Run Out Of Money"
 BLK_no_money_idea_desc:0 "Belka's government has gone into full bankruptcy, unable to support itself or get any kind of bailout, causing a complete collapse in the chain of command. No one knows where their next paycheck, if any, will come from."

 BLK_own_excalibur_fire_idea:0 "Excalibur Fire Support"
 BLK_own_excalibur_fire_idea_desc:0 "Enemy air operations are severly limited by Excalibur's laser. Push forward!"
 
 ### FOCUSES ###
 BLK_the_crisis_continues:0 "The Crisis Continues"
 BLK_the_crisis_continues_desc:0 "Our nation has been in a severe crisis for several years now, with no end in sight. The longer this drags on, the less likely we will be able to recover. It's time to look at this situation for what it is, and analyze the finer details of it."
 BLK_country_wide_protests:0 "Country Wide Protests"
 BLK_country_wide_protests_desc:0 "The complete collapse of living standards in our country has skyrocketed discontent with our administration, and hundreds of people across the nation are protesting en masse. If we are not careful, we could make things much worse. We will investigate these protests and see how we can alleviate their issues, or at least placate them."
 BLK_economy_in_pieces:0 "Collapsing Economy"
 BLK_economy_in_pieces_desc:0 "It goes without saying that all this trouble originated from the economic stagnation, then recession, which itself originated from poor management of our funds. We need to get a better perspective on just how bad the damage is, and what methods we can take to fix it."
 BLK_no_work_place:0 "No Work For People"
 BLK_no_work_place_desc:0 "The closing of hundreds of both local and national businesses has laid off millions of people, which is a self-replicating issue in itself as well as causing many more issues. We need to study the scale of this unemployment and get stats on how much we have to work with, and how much time we have left before it becomes unrecoverable."
 BLK_no_money:0 "No Money"
 BLK_no_money_desc:0 "We have hit rock bottom. Our attempted programs to get a scale of the crisis have burned through the last of our resources, and we are now powerless to do anything. We are now forced to resort to desperate measures to keep our entire nation from falling apart."
 BLK_sell_the_land:0 "Sell Off The Belkan Land"
 BLK_sell_the_land_desc:0 "We may have found a way to buy time. Our rival, the Osean Federation, has offered to purchase a portion of our western territories for a sizable sum of money, allowing us to kickstart some recovery programs. It pains us to take such a humiliating deal with our enemy, but we have no other option."
 BLK_osean_prop:0 "Great Lakes Resource Development Company"
 BLK_osean_prop_desc:0 "The Oseans have expressed interest in a joint resource excavation company focused around the Great Lakes region, which has shown great promise according to them. Their sudden cooperation is somewhat suspicious, but this could be key to restarting our economy."
 BLK_wait_for_profit:0 "Await The Results"
 BLK_wait_for_profit_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Resource Company has gone online, and we have put our remaining resources into it. All we have to do now is wait for the profits from the resource exports. Once that comes in, we can start the recovery process. Perhaps the Oseans aren't so bad after all."
 BLK_dark_times:0 "[Root.GetBLKDarkTimeName]"
 BLK_dark_times_desc:0 "[Root.GetBLKDarkTimeDesc]"
 BLK_dark_times_good:0 "Future Awaits"
 BLK_dark_times_good_desc:0 "#Placeholder#"
 BLK_dark_times_bad:0 "Darkest Clouds Over Belka"
 BLK_dark_times_bad_desc:0 "We are truly in dark times now. Our populace is in open rebellion, we have once again exhausted our resources, and our national pride has been shattered by the Oseans. There is nothing we can do now. Belka is lost."
 
 BLK_dlp_victory:0 "DLP In Power"
 BLK_dlp_victory_desc:0 "At last, nothing stands in Belka's way. The cowardly conservatives simply wished their problems away, too scared to ever take action. The weak-kneed liberals bowed to our greatest enemy, the Oseans, to try and save themselves. We will do what they could not. We will allow Belka to take her rightful place atop the world. To live and thrive, that is what we will accomplish. Rejoice, for Belka is young again."
 BLK_to_save_what_we_can:0 "To Save What We Can"
 BLK_to_save_what_we_can_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures. The previous parties have left Belka in such a state of ruin that we will need to take drastic action to save the nation. However, this will show our people that we will not idly sit by and watch our nation decay, which if they are smart, they will see as worth the cost."
 BLK_downsizing_focus:0 "Downsizing And Downscaling"
 BLK_downsizing_focus_desc:0 "Despite the very obvious downsides, the previous governments continued to spend large amount of money and resources to maintain our oversized military. While a powerful military is important, we know that to survive we must spend our resources on developing a strong economic foundation on which to sustain that military."
 BLK_revitalise_civ_eco:0 "Demobilisation And Revitalisation"
 BLK_revitalise_civ_eco_desc:0 "Rather than build completely new factories, tools, and machines for our industry, we have plenty of surplus equipment from our recent downsizing of the military. We can repurpose these into the civilian market to cut some costs of launching and maintaining new programs, allowing us to widen our options of industrial programs."
 BLK_new_workplaces:0 "Public Work Projects"
 BLK_new_workplaces_desc:0 "Many of Belka's old public works have fallen into neglect or disrepair following the economic crisis, or even the budget reorganization before that. Reviving these will raise the people's faith in our government, provide more services to our citizens, and raise their national pride to be Belkan. This will be a crucial step in restoring our image, both at home and across the world."
 BLK_put_people_to_work:0 "Emigrants, Unemployed And Prisoners"
 BLK_put_people_to_work_desc:0 "The economic crash has caused mass layoffs and unemployment, grinding our industry to a halt. This is too big an issue to resolve right now, however some members of our administration have developed an idea to provide some easy, cheap labor to get the ball rolling."
 BLK_seeds_of_industry:0 "Manipulation, Fabrication And Other Market Strategies"
 BLK_seeds_of_industry_desc:0 "The economic market is a ruthless battleground, and if we wish to harness it to our advantage we must be willing to use any means necessary to control it, even means which might not be well liked. It's all for the greater good, anyway."
 BLK_dev_south_belka:0 "Develop South Belka"
 BLK_dev_south_belka_desc:0 "South Belka is a region of our nation which was never developed significantly, however there is plenty of space for new buildings there. We will develop this land specifically, as it will provide the greatest amount of possibilities for further development."
 BLK_dev_heart_of_the_nation:0 "Develop Heart Of The Nation"
 BLK_dev_heart_of_the_nation_desc:0 "The north of Belka is well defended and central to our nation. We can build off existing infrastructure and continue developments here as it will give us a quick return on investment in addition to serving our nation for years to come."
 BLK_end_of_the_chain:0 "Domestic Stability"
 BLK_end_of_the_chain_desc:0 "Through some quick thinking, we've managed to stem the tide of the crisis and bring some badly needed relief to our people. From here, we can start planning our next moves to put this nightmare behind us."
 BLK_fuel_reconstruction:0 "To Fuel Our Reconstruction"
 BLK_fuel_reconstruction_desc:0 "Our own ability to recover has been crippled. If we are to survive this, as painful as it is, we will need to get help from outside nations. If we can scrounge up whatever resources we have and set a trading presence again, we will be able to attract international businesses to our borders once again."
 BLK_resources:0 "Develop Resources Excavation"
 BLK_resources_desc:0 "We've set up a nice foothold to base our international platform on, but this will not suffice. We must continue excavation efforts to increase the amount of resources we can export to other nations and create further demand."
 BLK_fuel_nationalisation:0 "Nationalise Remains Of "Crescens OIL""
 BLK_fuel_nationalisation_desc:0 "Crescens OIL was an offshore oil excavation company based off our northern coast which provided the majority of the oil to Belka. After being hit hard by the economic crisis and now with Crescens being owned by Osea, not much remains of this company. If we nationalize it, we can save what's left of it, as well as be able to extract further oil with no strings attached."
 BLK_tools_and_machinery:0 "Buy New Tools And Machinery"
 BLK_tools_and_machinery_desc:0 "Belka's industrial foundation hasn't been updated or even really analyzed since the beginning of the crisis, and as a result our tools are likely one or more generations out of date. If we empower our factories through modernizing their tools, we will see efficiency rise in factories all across the nation, not limited to a specific area, group, or company."
 BLK_focus_our_eco:0 "Focus Our Economic Efforts"
 BLK_focus_our_eco_desc:0 "Our economic policies and style of management are very old and suited to a much earlier era, and are likely not nearly as efficient as some of our neighbors. Reshuffling management and reforming laws and quotas to fit this will let our main factories run like a well oiled machine again."
 BLK_expand_rails:0 "Expand National Rail System"
 BLK_expand_rails_desc:0 "Aside from incrasing our production capabilities, we need to make sure that resources and goods can be easily transported throughout our nation. In the old administration, deliveries could be lost or delayed rather easily, however by standardizing all railways and expanding the federal rail system we can coordinate transportation much more efficiently than ever before."
 BLK_start_of_the_chain:0 "Investment Opportunities"
 BLK_start_of_the_chain_desc:0 "With our foreign trade status recovering, investors are seeing Belka as a land of opportunity, and as each one joins in, the prospect becomes more and more enticing, starting a exponential chain of investments. With this, we can improve our domestic industry until we're back on our feet."
 
 BLK_party_disagreements:0 "Party Disagreements"
 BLK_party_disagreements_desc:0 "Our recent choices in how to allow our economy to recover has upset a number of people in our party, most notably the militarists, who are upset with our cuts of their budget. These voices have grown louder over time, and are already threatening to disrupt our party's control."
 BLK_talks_in_shadows:0 "Talks In Shadows"
 BLK_talks_in_shadows_desc:0 "Surprisingly, all the dissenting politicians and officials have quieted down, almost overnight. While this does make affairs easier for us, we can't help but shake the feeling that something suspicious is going on..."
 BLK_pull_the_trigger:0 "Pull The Trigger"
 BLK_pull_the_trigger_desc:0 "The time has come. The pacifist devils have crippled our military, the only thing we have, allowing foreign influence to creep in. We will clean house of these wolves, and restore Belka's strength before it is too late."
 BLK_nationalism_unleashed:0 "Nationalism Unleashed"
 BLK_nationalism_unleashed_desc:0 "There is no higher honor than to be a Belkan. Our people have forgotten this, and have gotten hung up on petty issues in our nation, tearing each other apart. We must remind them of who they are, and what it truly means to be Belkan."
 BLK_taking_off_the_kid_gloves:0 "Taking Off The Kid Gloves"
 BLK_taking_off_the_kid_gloves_desc:0 "Too many politicians are afraid of other nations, and strive to placate them to save their own skin. Not ours. We are not afraid to show the world our strength. They have more reason to fear us than we do to fear them."
 
 BLK_cult_of_belka:0 "The Cult Of Belka"
 BLK_cult_of_belka_desc:0 "What is Belka? A nation, some might say. But no. Nor is it a place, a government, or even a people. Belka is an idea. A concept, which we all must work towards creating. We will spread the word far and wide, that every citizen must do their part to reveal what Belka is in its truest form."
 BLK_police_state:0 "Enact Martial Law"
 BLK_police_state_desc:0 "Although we have control for now, it is inevitable that misguided people will come to oppose us. Enacting martial law will give us more control over the nation, and will severely stunt opposition efforts to foil our recovery."
 BLK_autarky:0 "Autarky Doctrine"
 BLK_autarky_desc:0 "If there is anything that the previous governments' experiences with trading with other nations has proved, is that they cannot be trusted. Why should we give them any resources when we know they will be used against us? From now on, all of Belka's resources belong to Belka, not any other nation."
 BLK_spirit_of_belkan_militarism:0 "An Army With A State"
 BLK_spirit_of_belkan_militarism_desc:0 "Going all the way back to the ancient Belkan Knights, Belka's existence has always been inseperable from the strength of its military. We must think less of the government as the controller of the military, but more as a guide for it. Most nations are states with armies, Belka is an army with a state."
 BLK_fortify_the_west:0 "Fortify The East"
 BLK_fortify_the_west_desc:0 "After the conservatives foolishly allowed parts of our nation to secede, they have now taken up arms against us. We will bring these lands back into their rightful place, but first we must prepare. Fortifying our border with them will give us a safe place to strike from."
 BLK_new_blood:0 "New Blood In The Leadership"
 BLK_new_blood_desc:0 "After going through this many divisions, our government is rather understaffed. Bringing in new, promising, and loyal people will strengthen our position, and help pave the way to Belka's future."
 BLK_women_in_industry:0 "Women In The Workforce"
 BLK_women_in_industry_desc:0 "It is wrong for us to put women onto the battlefield, endangering them. A much safer option that still allows women to contribute to our nation is by opening up industry positions for them, further bolstering our industrial capabilites."
 BLK_women_in_army:0 "Conscription Without Exception"
 BLK_women_in_army_desc:0 "Anyone who can hold a gun and follow orders is fit to serve in our army. The opportunity to fight for Belka is among the highest honor ever dreamed of, and it would be wrong to prevent anyone from partaking in it."
 BLK_gott_mit_uns:0 "Gott Mit Uns"
 BLK_gott_mit_uns_desc:0 "To thrive, every aspect of Belka must be united. We cannot allow for a multitude of faiths to control our people, there must be one truth preached to all our people, reminding them of our single united purpose. "
 BLK_excalibur:0 "Excalibur Project"
 BLK_excalibur_desc:0 "Excalibur, a long-range anti-missile laser defense system, has been in development for just over a decade now. It was nearly finished when the crisis occured and funding was cut. We will finish this program and protect our skies from missile attacks."
 BLK_form_bs:0 "Form BSF"
 BLK_form_bs_desc:0 "The Belkan Special Forces, elite divisions comprised of the best of the best, have been suggested by many people in the past, however were never successfully created. We will finally create them, serving as both an elite spearhead division for difficult operations, and as a symbol of Belka's might to the world."
 BLK_avalon:0 "Avalon Dam Project"
 BLK_avalon_desc:0 "Disguised as a simple hydroelectric dam, Avalon Dam is a high-tech testing facility as well as a launch site for ICBMs. Much like our other project, it was near completion when funding was cut. We will finish the facility and use it to continue research and development of cutting-edge military technology, before the lack of care allows someone to discover its true purpose."
 BLK_drill_the_army:0 "Loyalty Above All"
 BLK_drill_the_army_desc:0 "After filling our ranks, we need to instill a sense of duty in our new recruits. All soldiers, politicians, workers, everyone, will be taught from a young age that loyalty to Belka is the utmost priority. Nothing else comes close."
 BLK_unemployment:0 "Crush The Unemployment"
 BLK_unemployment_desc:0 "Many people in our nation are adrift, lacking cause or purpose, without any drive. Forcing anyone without a job into the arms production sector will give them a purpose and a sense of duty, as well as give them a productive use to our nation while significantly boosting our production."
 BLK_militarise_civilian_infr:0 "Militarise Civilian Infrastructure"
 BLK_militarise_civilian_infr_desc:0 "Many people are showing resistance to our new consription policy. We will show them that in Belka, the military is not just a force, it is a way of life. We will bring the military into all aspects of the civilian sector, showing them they cannot simply escape it."
 BLK_new_supply_dep:0 "Expand Supply Network"
 BLK_new_supply_dep_desc:0 "Our conscription policy has forced many people into the military, some of whom don't seem to want to be there. Rather than force them to fight against their will, we will open up opportunities for them to help in supplying the frontline, putting them in far less danger while still making use of them."
 BLK_overspending_on_military:0 "Fuel The Engines"
 BLK_overspending_on_military_desc:0 "The pacifists and other parties described the previous government as "overspending" on the military. The truth is, they were not spending enough on it. The military is the spirit and strength of Belka, and no price is high enough to keep it strong. We will restore the budget to its original state, empowering the military once again."
 BLK_military_industrial_complex:0 "Reawake Belkan Military Industrial Complex"
 BLK_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "The military and industrial companies are closely related to each other and increasing their cooperation is a guranteed way to keep them both strong and stable. Bringing the two together again will allow us to power our army like never before."
 BLK_quantity:0 "Quantity Ideas"
 BLK_quantity_desc:0 "The enemy nations seek to control Belka's people. If every man, woman and child in Belka were to fight back, not only would they prove a near impossible enemy to defeat, but the lack of controllable people would render any invasion pointless, giving us unique power over our enemies. We will allow anyone who wishes to serve the the ability to do so by arming the masses."
 BLK_quantity_2:0 "Use The Unusable"
 BLK_quantity_2_desc:0 "Even those who might be overlooked by society have a purpose to us. Criminals have signed away their rights, and as a result there is no harm in us placing them on the frontlines. The promise of freedom for service will prevent them from rebelling, as well as a constant watch on their actions."
 BLK_quality:0 "Quality Ideas"
 BLK_quality_desc:0 "Belkan knights were the pride of the ancient world for their discipline and courage. Rather than carelessly throw waves of men at the enemy, we will train and drill our soldiers to the core, reminding them of the legacy they carry. They will rival their ancient counterparts in their strength and glory."
 BLK_quality_2:0 "Belkan Assault Tactics"
 BLK_quality_2_desc:0 "Good doctrine is just as critical to success as good soliders are. Our old doctrines are getting rather outdated, and as a result we may suffer against advanced foes. Reforming our doctrine and keeping it fresh in our soldiers' minds will keep them alive, and strengthen their efficiency."
 BLK_infantry_focus:0 "The Backbone Of The Army"
 BLK_infantry_focus_desc:0 "No army in history ever had success from neglecting its infantry. The most versatile of any combat unit devised, if our army is mostly composed of infantry it makes sense to devote the most investments into the infantry as well."
 BLK_mech:0 "Develop The Support Core"

 ### EVENTS ###
 
 belka.1.t:0 "Nation In Pieces"
 belka.1.d:0 "Our nation is in pain. The continued overspending on the military has wrecked our economy, which in turn has caused businesses to downsize, laying off workers, making them spend less, further drying up economic growth, causing company after company to close their doors. Without the goods and services offered by many of these companies, it has gotten harder and harder for our citizens to source food, pay bills, or provide for their families. This, in turn, has caused drastically increased radicalization and polarization of our populace, who turn to radical idealisms as their only hope of change. Even worse, due to our nation being in this state for quite some time, even our resources in the government are now beginning to run thin."
 belka.1.a:0 "God Save Belka."
 
 belka.2.t:0 "People On The Streets"
 belka.2.d:0 "The scope of the protests is far greater than we ever imagined. Nearly every day has some kind of major protest happening somewhere in our country, and crimes have also seen exponential growth compared to when this all began. Masses of people are calling for all sorts of demands, from more reform programs all the way to calls for outright revolution. The silver lining in this is that the sheer mass of protesters makes them unable to unite or organize effectively, making them less of a threat than an organized group. Regardless, this will only buy us some time, as if we continue to leave this issue unresolved they will no doubt find a way to organize."
 belka.2.a:0 "They just need to wait a little longer."
 
 belka.3.t:0 "Economy Long Gone"
 belka.3.d:0 "Our economy has had negative growth for over a year now, and the effects are extremely obvious. The vast majority of our nation lives below the poverty line, as the middle class has been all but obliterated. More than half of the small businesses in the country have closed, and about a third of the large businesses went bankrupt or were bought out. International companies and investors saw the writing on the wall long ago and have left for greener pastures, meaning there's no external group we can use to leverage ourselves back onto our feet. Worst of all, now our own funds in the government have begun to dry up, and we've had to downsize our own government and print larger amounts of currency to offset our expenses. However, even that is wearing thin and the inflation is devaluing our money faster than we can print enough to compensate it."
 belka.3.a:0 "We just have to keep printing."
 
 belka.4.t:0 "Mass Exodus"
 belka.4.d:0 "Unemployment is only the tip of the iceberg. Workers, scientists, doctors, lawyers, even our own officials are emigrating to other countries to find work, and at an alarming rate. The lack of job opportunities in Belka is causing workers to look elsewhere, even outside their home country, to provide for their families. Some are even taking their families with them. Houses run empty and border checkpoints are crowded as people scramble to exit the country. Not only have we lost our workforce, but we will be unable to recover them if we cannot stop this outflow of people. If this keeps up, there won't even be a Belka to revive."
 belka.4.a:0 "Close the borders!"
 
 belka.5.t:0 "Complete Collapse"
 belka.5.d:0 "It appears, ironically, that our last efforts to take inventory on the crisis pushed us over the tipping point. Our budget this month was unable to meet the expenses, and as a result we, as a nation, are in complete bankruptcy. As our officials find out, many are simply getting up and leaving. We are completely powerless and at the whims of whatever the future brings. The only influence we have is off goodwill alone, and that will not get us far. The future is dark."
 belka.5.a:0 "Just when we were getting started."
 
 belka.6.t:0 "Government Falls Apart"
 belka.6.d:0 "The word is out. The jig is up. Everyone knows about the state of the government, and almost everyone in any position of power has either been forced out or simply walked out. Belka is in a state of anarchy. It is impossible to even tell what is happening in the country because all sources of information we could use is gone or takes orders from someone new now. Dinsmark is empty."
 belka.6.a:0 "What will become of us?"
 
 belka.7.t:0 "New Elections, New Rule"
 belka.7.d:0 "After the collapse of the BCNP's administration, an emergency election was called by the Alternative Wege to regain control of the government. Unsurprisingly, they came out on top, with the BNCP scattered between the DLP, Wege itself, and the rest joining the monarchist movement. With the liberals now in power and promising to fix the mistakes of the past no matter how difficult it may be, a sliver of hope has returned that new leaders may bring about change."
 belka.7.a:0 "Time to sort this mess out."
 
 belka.8.t:0 "Osean Proposition"
 belka.8.d:0 "Our longtime rival, the Osean Federation, have approached us with an interesting offer. In return for giving several of our eastern territories to the neighboring countries, and selling a portion of the Great Lakes to Osea itself, the Oseans will pay us a rather high sum of money, giving us the ability to start some recovery programs. Osea has even expressed that they would be willing to lease many of the resources in the area to us through a joint resource excavation company. Some in the government are suspicious of this deal, since it's unlikley that Osea would offer us such a deal without a clear benefit to them, but others are hopeful that it could be the beginning of a new era of cooperation between our nations, as well as our lifeline to save our nation. It is a rather humiliating deal to take, but what other choice do we have?"
 belka.8.a:0 "Better to lose a part of our nation than to lose the whole nation."
 
 belka.9.t:0 "Selling Of The Land"
 belka.9.d:0 "With all the paperwork in place, we've agreed to the Oseans' proposal and are preparing to remove our forces from the land. The transactions have been made and we now have enough money to get a few programs going. For their cooperation, [BLK.GetLeader] has suggested we take the Oseans up on their joint resource company offer, something that will give us a reliable income from which to rebuild the rest of our country off of."
 belka.9.a:0 "The best thing this deal gave us was hope."
 
 belka.10.t:0 "GLRDC Goes Live"
 belka.10.d:0 "The Great Lakes Resource Development Company opened up today, marking our second cooperation with the Oseans. Early reports have showed us show promising amounts of resources in the area, meaning this will likely be a very lucrative deal. Digging has begun and we've invested more of our money into the program to see a profit as quickly as we can. Things are looking up for us, we may just be able to refloat our economy with this."
 belka.10.a:0 "Maybe the Oseans aren't so bad after all."
 
 belka.11.t:0 "The Results Are In"
 belka.11.d:0 "They lied to us. \n\n The Oseans lied to us about the resources. There weren't even any to begin with in that area. To add insult to injury, we're getting reports in the eastern countries that the territories we sold have plentiful resources in them, that now those countries are exploiting to their full potential. We are now down almost all the money we got from the original deal, and now there does not appear to be any sort of tool or program we can use to save ourselves."
 belka.11.a:0 "We just can't catch a break."
 
 belka.12.t:0 "Total Anarchy"
 belka.12.d:0 "After the news of the Osean scam got out, the public has been whirled back into a frenzy, and our attempts at damage control seem to have completely failed. We've run out of money again, and now the [BLK.GetRulingParty] is seeing mass defections to the communists and monarchists. The public is completely uncontrollable and the nation is in complete anarchy."
 belka.12.a:0 "What can even be done at this point?"
 
 belka.13.t:0 "New Power At The Top"
 belka.13.d:0 "Over the past few days, an intense battle between the DLP and the monarchists ensued across the country, with the DLP now the undisputed dominant power in the country. With the DLP's support in the military assisting them, they have secured control over all apparatuses of state and now are the new leaders of the country, with most of the opposition imprisoned or jailed. With its third government in the last few months, it remains to be seen if the DLP will solve any of the issues plaguing the country."
 belka.13.a:0 "Nothing will stand in our way."
 
 belka_dlp.1.t:0 "Many People, One Nation, One Goal"
 belka_dlp.1.d:0 "Belka has been wounded, not just by her enemies but also by her own supposed leaders, each of whom pulled her apart seeking their own goals. The failiures of the previous governments showed they were not fit to lead Belka. Now it is our turn. We will unite the people and raise Belka from the ashes, ascendent to the top of the world. With no one left to stand in our way, the DLP will restore Belka to its former glory and beyond. We have much to do, and the people's patience is thin because of the past, so we must waste no time in getting to work. Many of our members have already put forward ideas to start our recovery, which will provide us with a head start on our recovery."
 belka_dlp.1.a:0 "Belka will rise again."
 
 belka_dlp.2.t:0 "The 2 Year Plan"
 belka_dlp.2.d:0 "After intense discussion, we have arrived at a conclusion on how to start our reconstruction. While the military is all we have left, and is necessary for our self-preservation, this is exactly what we will use to our advantage. Converting a large amount of our military production into civilan will allow us to start economic growth without many funds to go off of, and our military is powerful enough as it is to ward off any potential invasions from Osea. This will upset the militarist faction in our government, but in all likelyhood they will come around when our economy recovers, which we can use to expand the military from once again."
 belka_dlp.2.a:0 "We must use what we have."
 
 belka_dlp.3.t:0 "Magic Of Bureaucracy"
 belka_dlp.3.d:0 "Through some decisive means, we've found a way to get back at those wretched Oseans. We still technically have a share in the Great Lakes Resource Development Company, but who said we have to use it for that purpose? Using some underhanded methods and pulling strings, we've managed to convert some of the resources used in that project to produce some industry for our own benefit. This will only work for so long before either the Oseans find out and shut down the company, or the company itself dries up, but it's a nice boost, and one that sticks it to the Oseans."
 belka_dlp.3.a:0 "Revenge will come one day. But this is nice."
 
 belka_dlp.4.t:0 "Harsh Countermeasures"
 belka_dlp.4.d:0 "Getting jobs for the unemployed is a rather large task, however a mitigation we can use to still get some usable labor is by introducing forced labor and community service for prisoners in our nation. To bolster these numbers, we have criminalized emigration and remaining unemployed, which should hopefully give us an edge against unemployment, at the cost of some public opinion."
 belka_dlp.4.a:0 "It's voluntary, because you voluntarily committed a crime!"
 
 belka_dlp.5.t:0 "Regulate Trade Policy"
 belka_dlp.5.d:0 "To recover our economy, we'll need to prompt trade with other nations, but we need to make sure we're gaining a strong profit from it. Rather than allow companies to do free business, we'll make sure that any trade goes through us before it is approved, allowing us to take a cut of the sale, letting us improve the economy itself. With any luck, this process will repeat exponentially, encouraging investors despite the tax of our government on their transactions."
 belka_dlp.5.a:0 "A slice for me and a slice for you."

 belka_dlp_coup.1.t:0 "Clashes Within The Party"
 belka_dlp_coup.1.d:0 "We always expected opposition, at least from the public, and from within our own party to an extent, but we didn't expect it to be around this long. We've begun a number of recovery programs and are already seeing the first fruits of recovery, and yet the militarist faction of our government led by Waldemarr Rald has only dissented louder and louder with each reform that we make, cutting into the military's budget. Unfortunately for us, many of the close-minded officers and generals in the Belkan Armed Forces are seeing these budget cuts as attacks on their livelihood and siding with Rald. It's begun to affect our ability in decision-making, meaning we'll likely need to find a way to please Rald and his militarists."
 belka_dlp_coup.1.a:0 "Can't you just be patient?"
 
 belka_dlp_coup.2.t:0 "Support In The Military"
 belka_dlp_coup.2.d:0 "Almost as soon as we began discussing possible resolutions with Rald, he seems to have disappeared, as well as most of his supporters. We're unsure if they're plotting something, are attempting to force our cabinet into stasis by not meeting the seat count, or if they simply gave up, but in any case it seems the issue resolved itself. Worryingly, many of the heads of the Armed Forces have come forward announcing support for Rald, but despite this outflow of support he has yet to make any appearances."
 belka_dlp_coup.2.a:0 "Back to business."
 
 belka_dlp_coup.3.t:0 "The Coup"
 belka_dlp_coup.3.d:0 "Early yesterday morning, during a regular meeting between Lehmann and several members of the Assembly, a division of the Belkan Army stormed the Dinsmark Parliment Building, capturing those inside and killing any security forces or politicians who resisted. Over the next 24 hours, similar attacks were carried out all across Belkan government buildings with large success, at which point Rald has come forward announcing that a large number of members of the incumbent government were intentionally weakening Belka with the intention of allowing an Osean invasion, and that he has rounded up most of these "traitors" and will be replacing Berthold Lehmann as the head of government. While not many people believe this story, Rald's grip on the military prevents any organized opposition to his new regime."
 belka_dlp_coup.3.a:0 "Third time's the charm?"
 
 belka_dlp_coup.4.t:0 "Ein Volk, Ein Nation, Ein Ziel!"
 belka_dlp_coup.4.d:0 "President Rald held a public speech today, calling for the Belkan people to put aside their differences and remember that they are, above all else, Belkans, and that is what matters. Nationalism has always been high after the Osean scam in the Great Lakes, and it seems Rald is capitalizing on this, uniting the people under their nationality. This has alarmed several nations around us, mostly Osea and our former member nations, but domestically this speech has seen Rald's approval ratings increase greatly."
 belka_dlp_coup.4.a:0 "Belka must be one if she is to survive."
 
 belka_dlp_coup.5.t:0 "Total War"
 belka_dlp_coup.5.d:0 "The humliation and shame inflicted on us not just by Osea, but also the foolish conservatives who allowed Belkan territory to secede in the 1987 Federal Law Review, cannot be allowed to stand. Waldemarr Rald held a meeting with his cabinet today promising an immenent revenge war against Osea and the former states, reclaiming lost Belkan territory, as soon as the military is restored back to its former level. While he has not gone public with this information, he has constantly blamed Osea and the other nations for poisoning Belka, and promises citizens that things will be made right. Rald promises to his cabinet a state of 'total war,' as he describes it- 'To wage war with all tools, methods, resources, and weapons that you have at your disposal, to fight tooth and nail with everything you have until victory or annhilation.'"

 belka_dlp_coup.6.t:0 "Excalibur Online" #construction of the excalibur was finished, there is room for some modifications and improvments from original design
 belka_dlp_coup.6.d:0 "Excalibur, the chemical laser anti-ICBM system devised as a part of the large military build-up of the past couple decades, has finally been finished with our efforts. The designs have changed slightly since the original proposed design from 1981, however the core design has remained mostly unchanged. These designs have allowed us to make the design more modular, including swappable lenses for different ranges and targets, as well as heat transferring pipes to allow the main structure to assist in cooling as well as the six primary cooling towers. This also has allowed for possible future improvements on the design, but for now we have a simple choice to make on where to invest the last of the project's leftover budget. We could develop an electronic targeting system that syncs up with radar data, allowing Excalibur to easily target agile objects like aircraft, boosting our air superiority capabilities. We could even invest in a denser power system, allowing the laser to reach higher temperatures and give it the ability to assist in ground attacks. Or we could simply keep it to its original purpose and improve its ICBM destruction capabilities."

 belka_dlp_coup.7.d:0 "Started in 1985, the Avalon Dam facility was designed as an undercover top-secret research facility to aid the development of Project Pendragon, our nuclear ICBM program, as well as other classified high-tech projects. While Project Pendragon has already been finished, the facility itself will allow us to develop more weapons and advancements a step above the rest of the world. However, now that this facility has been completed, we must make sure it stays secure. While we could keep the garrison the same as any other military installation, to avoid suspicion, the criticality of the projects being worked on presents a high risk. We could station the former head of Project Pendragon as well as a top ace in the Belkan Air Force, Dr. Anton Kupchenko, head of the "Gault Squadron" at the base, where he could assist in both research and security, as the projects worked on there will likely be continuations of his own work. Alternatively, we could also station the newly-formed Belkan Special Forces at the facility, while this would not allow the research benefits the BSF will likely have a much tighter hold on the facility, making it much more secure, as well as ensure that the BSF will be the first to recieve any new high-tech infantry weapons developed on-site."

 belka_dlp_coup.8.d:0 "Religion is a large part of people's lives in Belka, and for the church to disagree with the state would cause dissent within the nation. To combat this, Waldemarr Rald has decided to declare the United Church of Belka, to ensure that the church does not teach dissenting thoughts against the state. This new organization will need a leader from the religious sector that will not be seen as a mere puppet. The three best possible candidates have been presented to Rald, and we now await his answer. Father Hannes Kellermann, head of the Church of Dinsmark, has been an outspoken loyalist of the DLP and while he was originally supportive of the pacifist wing of the party, has since come around and speaks extremely positively of Rald. He may not be very useful aside from his high charisma and undying loyalty, but the church will never be an issue as long as he is around. Opposite of him is Father Arnold Weinmann, a leading figure in the Lumen Cathedral, originally a member of the Alternative Wege, but reluctantly changed to the DLP after accusations of Osean sympathies. He is not an Osean sympathizer, however he greatly prefers the pacifist wing of the DLP, and has yet to endorse Rald publicly, making his loyalty questionable. Despite that, he used to work as an economist during the military build-up several years ago, and likely could be of use in that area, assisting with our own build-up. Finally, we have Father Wilfried Jan Riese von Sergio Luoni, a former bishop from Hoffnung, who was removed from position after declaring many sects as heretical and claiming only he had the true interpretation of the Scriptures. He has since been excommunicated, but leads a small cult-like following in Sudentor, mostly popular with lower-class people and occultists.

 belka_dlp_war.1.d:0 "Yesterday, a news report was published in Ustio detailing mass deposits of precious metals beneath the surface of its mountains, extremely close to the surface, with the land market exploding overnight. Rald is beside himself with fury at the news, claiming that Ustio should cede all resource rights to Belka, as the resources had not been discovered when the conservatives foolishly allowed the Ustians to secede. With the new money, Ustio has already announced several new programs to stabilize themselves, much to our dismay. A small paper trail suggests that Osea might also have been intentionally hiding these resources until Ustio declared its independence, also lending credibility to the theory that Osea funded Ustian independence movements as well. Rald has declared to his cabinet that this has been the last straw, and is preparing the military for imminent war within the next six months."

 belka_dlp_war.2.d:0 "The time has come. Waldemarr Rald announced publicly that the crimes and humiliation committed against Belka by its neighbors had reached a breaking point, announcing that Belka would be moving into it's rightful territories, and that any resistance will be crushed, effectively declaring war against its neighbors. In response, Osea has invited all nations to an alliance they refer to as the "Allied Forces" against Belka. Sapin, their ally, and Ustio have joined this faction while Recta, Gebet, and FATO, likely fearing Osean control, have declared their own alliance, the "Anti-Belkan Northern Front." Regardless, this war will be very costly for all sides, and seeing our unstable situation, it is critical that we show quick success in this war else the public lose faith in our government and our economy deteriorate back to its original state, or worse."

 belka_dlp_war.3.d:0 "Excalibur, our chemical laser anti-ICBM weapon, has been destroyed in a massive raid by the Osean Air Defense Force and Ustian Air Force, completely eliminating its viability. Despite massive losses and fierce resistance from our forces, the four RTLS systems and the surrounding support weapons were slowly picked off by the aircraft, before destroying the lens itself, then finally targeting the central structure until it collapsed, rendering it completely unsalvageable. While we still own the territory underneath Excalibur, the weapon is completely unusable and would not be repairable without a complete rebuilding of the structure. While this does not mean a complete loss, this will greatly set back our ability to project power around our nation, and we will need to be much more careful about which battles we have the capacity to fight in the future."

 belka_dlp_war.97.t:0 "The Belkan War"
 belka_dlp_war.97.d:0 "The Belkan War was a large scale conflict that took part between the 25th of March, 1995 and June 20th of the same year. It involved two of the largest superpowers of the world, being the bellicose nation of Belka and the Osean Federation with addition of all other Belkan neighbors. It all started after an unprecedented economic crisis hit Belka a decade earlier, leading to territorial concessions and a desperate population to seek hope and revenge in a far-right, militarist party, who used all Belka's remaining economic might to wage war against Ustio, a country that recently seceded and found enormous amounts of resources.\n\nThus, Belka declared war on all surrounding countries in a last-ditch attempt to gain supremacy in the Osean continent and regain all lost territories. After an initial setback, the attacked countries formed an alliance that counterattacked and pushed back Belkan forces, expoliting the inability of Belkan state to sustain equipment losses. With rumors, later confirmed, of Belka developing weapons of mass destruction, Allied forces continued to penetrate Belkan lands leading to the secession of the southern part of the nation, until the Belkan government, in a desperate attempt to save the northern part of the country, launched a nuclear attack along the Waldreich Mountains on June 6th, 1995.\n\nSeeing the insanity unfold, the Allies accepted Belka's sue for peace resulting in the peace conference of Lumen of June 20th."

 belka_dlp_war.98.d:0 "Following a continued lack of success in our military campaign, and growing weary of the constant bombings, casualties, and state of war, almost all major cities and townships in South Belka have agreed to surrender and demilitarize, refusing to host soldiers or produce war-related products. Unable to reinforce in these cities, we have been forced to retreat, begrudgingly allowing the Osean Army to move through these territories unimpeded. While not shattering, this is a major setback and represents a large portion of our country effectively taken over by the enemy, which we will now have to reclaim. We have already prepared defensive positions in the north and are drafting new battle plans, even some rather extreme ones. Despite this precedent, and the now-constant stream of defections to this rebel state, the fight is not over yet."

 belka_dlp_war.99.d:0 "As much as it burns to admit, the outcome of this war is not looking in our favor. Our casualties have grown dangerously high both from a tactical and civilian perspective, and we are losing ground and resources rapidly. To say the situation is dire is an understatement. If nothing is done, we must end the war, else we are ousted from power. However, we may have one final option to still prevent complete surrender. We still possess the two V2 MIRV nuclear missile systems we developed as the result of Project Pendragon, as well as many V1 nuclear warheads that can still be utilized. To use these weapons against Osea or their allies would be to spell death for ourselves, as nuclear retaliation would be inevitable. However, a desperate, but possible plan has been proposed: Detonating seven nuclear warheads at key pass points in the Waldreich mountain range would either force the Allied Forces to either move through the mountain range itself, or through an irradiated wasteland. It is a costly move, one that will hurt our image greatly, and shock and horrify both our citizens and people worldwide, but this shock will grant us our survival. None will wish to continue fighting us if they see how dedicated we are to our survival. We will not win this war, but we will not let Osea win either."

This action will put fear into the hearts of our people and the people of other nations alike, as nothing like this has ever been done in the history of the world. They will be shocked and horrified, and that will be our only chance. After the nuclear detonations, we must end the war immediately before their fear turns to fury. It is our last chance at the survival of Belkan honor. The only struggle after that will be keeping our nation afloat after this is done, as while we can drive off the invaders, we must regain the trust of the people for what we have done. It will be a long and bloody road, but we will finish what we started."

 belka_dlp_war.101.d:0 "A humiliating peace deal, but it allows our survival. The negotiations, signed in Lumen yesterday, cede the entirety of the demilitarized South Belka to Osea, finally completing their century-long conquest of the Great Lakes. While we are forced to return the territory we sold to the eastern nations, they do not gain any new territory, and South Belka is our only territorial loss. However, this is more than made up in the enormous quantity of reparations owed to all nations involved, despite our already pitiful economic state. To add insult to injury, massive limitations have been placed on our pride, the Belkan Armed Forces, limiting our soldiers, equipment, and research capabilities. If that wasn't enough, Osea will not return any companies, factories, or any kind of value in South Belka to us, leaving us even less tools to rebuild. Despite this extreme humiliation and defeat, we have managed to conceal the existence of the Avalon Dam facility as well as our remaining nuclear stockpile. Debate now remains on if we should use these weapons to enact a final revenge on Osea, even if it causes our demise, or using these tools to maintain our independence as we enter the next era. With the debates still ongoing, the future is unsure, but at last, war is over for now."

Lost territory has been reclaimed, with new puppet regimes in FATO, Gebet, and Recta to serve us, as well as new plunder from Osea giving us control over the Great Lakes and Futuro Canal. Osea has been beaten back to lick their wounds, and will have a much harder time challenging us in the future. With nothing left that can easily topple us, we are now free to pursue any claims or injustices we wish to rectify. Despite our victory, much of our nation has suffered, as well as our new conquests need much repair. But now, with new influence and resources at our fingertips, strengthening our armed forces as well as rebuilding our economy will be easier than ever before. Victory parades are rampant across Belka, and we look boldly to the future as we sign the next chapter in the history of the world, this one penned by the great nation of Belka."

We will show the cowards what it means to be a Belka, our soldiers will stand shoulder to shoulder, braced to defend their homeland to the death. Only two outcomes will come from this fight. We will stand victorious, or Belka shall be destroyed fully in the fighting, a hollow victory for the invader, as we will use every last drop of blood and oil in these lands to resist them, leaving nothing useful for them to take.

While we are able to control this directly using our authority, nullifying the effects, we must immediately gain resources to our economy upon invading our foes, as we won't be able to hold the floodgates forever.
