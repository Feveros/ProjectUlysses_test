 BLK_eco_crisis:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_desc:0 "Our economy is in utter shambles. Unemployment is at record heights, banks are defaulting, companies and individuals are filing for bankruptcy daily, and the value of our currency is in freefall. Every industrial field has been grinding to a halt, and if nothing is done it's likely our entire nation will descend into chaos.\n\nTo make matters worse, this has given rise to §RCommunist§! and §RSyndicalist§! groups, who are fully capitalizing off these failures."
 BLK_eco_crisis_2:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_2_desc:0 "Through some desperate measures, we've managed to mitigate the collapse of our economy. Nothing much has changed, but the worsening is slowing down. We must contine though, else these efforts will be for nothing."
 BLK_eco_crisis_3:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_3_desc:0 "We've managed to stall the decline of our economy enough to stop the continued damage. We've sacrificed a lot, and still have a long way to go, but the worst is behind us."
 BLK_eco_crisis_4:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_4_desc:0 "Our reconstruction programs appear to be having moderate success. We've been able to refloat some businesses and industries, and certain programs are recovering, but much of the nation is still in poverty."
 BLK_eco_crisis_5:0 "Belkan Economic Crisis"
 BLK_eco_crisis_5_desc:0 "We have almost put the crisis behind us. Life is returning to normal, and our last relief programs are working hard to restore our citizens' wellbeing. The long road is finally coming to an end."
 BLK_overspending_for_military:0 "Overspending On Military"
 BLK_overspending_for_military_desc:0 "In attempt to not fall behind the militaries of Osea and our other neighbors, we have poured an overly large amount of our budget into the military. Not only has this crippled our economy and gives the military sizable influence over the entirety of our country, but has also turned our military into a logistical nightmare."
 BLK_chaos_in_the_assembly:0 "Chaos In The Assembly"
 BLK_chaos_in_the_assembly_desc:0 "The National Assembly, our parliament, has been in a state of near-gridlock ever since our last election. The §Bconservative BNCP§!, §Cliberal Wege§!, and §Onationalist DLP§! have failed to pass almost any resolution, and as a result both our population and government are extremely restless and grow more polarized by the day.\n\nThis chaos has caused a number of politicians from all parties to support a return to an §Gabsolute monarchy§!, hoping it would return stability and order to the country."

 BLK_belka_wach_am_wal_idea_desc:0 ""In the face of an impending cataclysm, when the very fabric of existence unravels, a symphony of unity resonates, defying the inevitable demise. Bound by an unbreakable bond, we stand as a united front, facing the abyss with unwavering resolve. As the tempest of annihilation approaches, we cast aside our differences, transcending the divides that once kept us apart. Hand in hand, we emerge from the shadows of discord, kindling a flame of collective strength that engulfs our souls. In this crucible of chaos, unity becomes our shield, and the strength of our solidarity knows no bounds. Together, we stand resolute, our hearts beating as one amidst the throes of the world's final breath. For when faced with the ultimate reckoning, it is our unwavering unity that becomes our greatest weapon, a beacon of hope amidst the encroaching darkness. And as the world's final chapter unfolds, we shall inscribe upon its pages a testament to our indomitable spirit, proving that even in the face of the end, our unity shall prevail, transcending the boundaries of time and etching a legacy that shall forever endure."\n\nHans Friedrich Sturmburg, 1220\n"Gotterdammerung III""

 BLK_barghest_desc:0 ""With unwavering resolve and unyielding determination, they march forward, undeterred by the cost. Sacrificing blood and sweat, they unleash a torrent of unparalleled strength, wielding an unstoppable force that crushes all opposition.

 BLK_oberon_desc:0 ""Echoes of our homeland's fading heartbeat resonate. In a desperate plea, we beckon to those who have turned their backs on our nation, urging them to reclaim their place in its waning hours. The shadows of destruction loom large, and as the final act unfolds, we offer redemption to those who seize this fleeting chance. Yet, heed this warning: for those who refuse, who linger in exile, oblivion awaits. Our last breaths shall carry the weight of sacrifice, and those who refuse the call shall witness the annihilation of all they once knew. The choice is theirs to make, for in this final hour, salvation lies solely in our collective unity."\n\nHans Friedrich Sturmburg, 1245\n"Gotterdammerung XX""

With each dawn, a symphony of labor commences, as the hands of artisans and the sweat of toil shape the tapestry of our realm. Behold! The alchemical fusion of fire and metal kindles the sparks of progress, and within the anvil's embrace, our nation's soul is forged anew. As chimes of a smithy resound, let us heed the call of our old heritage, for in unity and labor, Albion's resplendent glory shall be rekindled, illuminating the path to a future carved by the hands of our ancestors."\n\nHans Friedrich Sturmburg, 1240\n"Gotterdammerung XIX""

 BLK_the_crisis_continues_desc:0 "Our nation has been in a severe crisis for several years now, with no end in sight. The longer this drags on, the less likely we will be able to recover. It's time to look at this situation for what it is, and analyze the finer details of it."
 BLK_country_wide_protests:0 "Country Wide Protests"
 BLK_country_wide_protests_desc:0 "The complete collapse of living standards in our country has skyrocketed discontent with our administration, and hundreds of people across the nation are protesting en masse. If we are not careful, we could make things much worse. We will investigate these protests and see how we can alleviate their issues, or at least placate them."
 BLK_economy_in_pieces:0 "Collapsing Economy"
 BLK_economy_in_pieces_desc:0 "It goes without saying that all this trouble originated from the economic stagnation, then recession, which itself originated from poor management of our funds. We need to get a better perspective on just how bad the damage is, and what methods we can take to fix it."
 BLK_no_work_place:0 "No Work For People"
 BLK_no_work_place_desc:0 "The closing of hundreds of both local and national businesses has laid off millions of people, which is a self-replicating issue in itself as well as causing many more issues. We need to study the scale of this unemployment and get stats on how much we have to work with, and how much time we have left before it becomes unrecoverable."
 BLK_no_money:0 "No Money"
 BLK_no_money_desc:0 "We have hit rock bottom. Our attempted programs to get a scale of the crisis have burned through the last of our resources, and we are now powerless to do anything. We are now forced to resort to desperate measures to keep our entire nation from falling apart."
 BLK_sell_the_land:0 "Sell Off The Belkan Land"
 BLK_sell_the_land_desc:0 "We may have found a way to buy time. Our rival, the Osean Federation, has offered to purchase a portion of our western territories for a sizable sum of money, allowing us to kickstart some recovery programs. It pains us to take such a humiliating deal with our enemy, but we have no other option."
 BLK_osean_prop:0 "Great Lakes Resource Development Company"
 BLK_osean_prop_desc:0 "The Oseans have expressed interest in a joint resource excavation company focused around the Great Lakes region, which has shown great promise according to them. Their sudden cooperation is somewhat suspicious, but this could be key to restarting our economy."
 BLK_wait_for_profit:0 "Await The Results"
 BLK_wait_for_profit_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Resource Company has gone online, and we have put our remaining resources into it. All we have to do now is wait for the profits from the resource exports. Once that comes in, we can start the recovery process. Perhaps the Oseans aren't so bad after all."

 BLK_dark_times_bad:0 "Darkest Clouds Over Belka"
 BLK_dark_times_bad_desc:0 "We are truly in dark times now. Our populace is in open rebellion, we have once again exhausted our resources, and our national pride has been shattered by the Oseans. There is nothing we can do now. Belka is lost."
 
 BLK_dlp_victory:0 "DLP In Power"
 BLK_dlp_victory_desc:0 "At last, nothing stands in Belka's way. The cowardly conservatives simply wished their problems away, too scared to ever take action. The weak-kneed liberals bowed to our greatest enemy, the Oseans, to try and save themselves. We will do what they could not. We will allow Belka to take her rightful place atop the world. To live and thrive, that is what we will accomplish. Rejoice, for Belka is young again."
 BLK_to_save_what_we_can:0 "To Save What We Can"
 BLK_to_save_what_we_can_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures. The previous parties have left Belka in such a state of ruin that we will need to take drastic action to save the nation. However, this will show our people that we will not idly sit by and watch our nation decay, which if they are smart, they will see as worth the cost."
 BLK_downsizing_focus:0 "Downsizing And Downscaling"
 BLK_downsizing_focus_desc:0 "Despite the very obvious downsides, the previous governments continued to spend large amount of money and resources to maintain our oversized military. While a powerful military is important, we know that to survive we must spend our resources on developing a strong economic foundation on which to sustain that military."
 BLK_revitalise_civ_eco:0 "Demobilisation And Revitalisation"
 BLK_revitalise_civ_eco_desc:0 "Rather than build completely new factories, tools, and machines for our industry, we have plenty of surplus equipment from our recent downsizing of the military. We can repurpose these into the civilian market to cut some costs of launching and maintaining new programs, allowing us to widen our options of industrial programs."
 BLK_new_workplaces:0 "Public Work Projects"
 BLK_new_workplaces_desc:0 "Many of Belka's old public works have fallen into neglect or disrepair following the economic crisis, or even the budget reorganization before that. Reviving these will raise the people's faith in our government, provide more services to our citizens, and raise their national pride to be Belkan. This will be a crucial step in restoring our image, both at home and across the world."
 BLK_put_people_to_work:0 "Emigrants, Unemployed And Prisoners"
 BLK_put_people_to_work_desc:0 "The economic crash has caused mass layoffs and unemployment, grinding our industry to a halt. This is too big an issue to resolve right now, however some members of our administration have developed an idea to provide some easy, cheap labor to get the ball rolling."
 BLK_seeds_of_industry:0 "Manipulation, Fabrication And Other Market Strategies"
 BLK_seeds_of_industry_desc:0 "The economic market is a ruthless battleground, and if we wish to harness it to our advantage we must be willing to use any means necessary to control it, even means which might not be well liked. It's all for the greater good, anyway."
 BLK_dev_south_belka:0 "Develop South Belka"
 BLK_dev_south_belka_desc:0 "South Belka is a region of our nation which was never developed significantly, however there is plenty of space for new buildings there. We will develop this land specifically, as it will provide the greatest amount of possibilities for further development."

 BLK_dev_heart_of_the_nation_desc:0 "The north of Belka is well defended and central to our nation. We can build off existing infrastructure and continue developments here as it will give us a quick return on investment in addition to serving our nation for years to come."
 BLK_end_of_the_chain:0 "Domestic Stability"
 BLK_end_of_the_chain_desc:0 "Through some quick thinking, we've managed to stem the tide of the crisis and bring some badly needed relief to our people. From here, we can start planning our next moves to put this nightmare behind us."
 BLK_fuel_reconstruction:0 "To Fuel Our Reconstruction"
 BLK_fuel_reconstruction_desc:0 "Our own ability to recover has been crippled. If we are to survive this, as painful as it is, we will need to get help from outside nations. If we can scrounge up whatever resources we have and set a trading presence again, we will be able to attract international businesses to our borders once again."
 BLK_resources:0 "Develop Resources Excavation"
 BLK_resources_desc:0 "We've set up a nice foothold to base our international platform on, but this will not suffice. We must continue excavation efforts to increase the amount of resources we can export to other nations and create further demand."
 BLK_fuel_nationalisation:0 "Nationalise Remains Of "Crescens OIL""
 BLK_fuel_nationalisation_desc:0 "Crescens OIL was an offshore oil excavation company based off our northern coast which provided the majority of the oil to Belka. After being hit hard by the economic crisis and now with Crescens being owned by Osea, not much remains of this company. If we nationalize it, we can save what's left of it, as well as be able to extract further oil with no strings attached."
 BLK_tools_and_machinery:0 "Buy New Tools And Machinery"
 BLK_tools_and_machinery_desc:0 "Belka's industrial foundation hasn't been updated or even really analyzed since the beginning of the crisis, and as a result our tools are likely one or more generations out of date. If we empower our factories through modernizing their tools, we will see efficiency rise in factories all across the nation, not limited to a specific area, group, or company."
 BLK_focus_our_eco:0 "Focus Our Economic Efforts"
 BLK_focus_our_eco_desc:0 "Our economic policies and style of management are very old and suited to a much earlier era, and are likely not nearly as efficient as some of our neighbors. Reshuffling management and reforming laws and quotas to fit this will let our main factories run like a well oiled machine again."
 BLK_expand_rails:0 "Expand National Rail System"
 BLK_expand_rails_desc:0 "Aside from incrasing our production capabilities, we need to make sure that resources and goods can be easily transported throughout our nation. In the old administration, deliveries could be lost or delayed rather easily, however by standardizing all railways and expanding the federal rail system we can coordinate transportation much more efficiently than ever before."
 BLK_start_of_the_chain:0 "Investment Opportunities"
 BLK_start_of_the_chain_desc:0 "With our foreign trade status recovering, investors are seeing Belka as a land of opportunity, and as each one joins in, the prospect becomes more and more enticing, starting a exponential chain of investments. With this, we can improve our domestic industry until we're back on our feet."
 
 BLK_party_disagreements:0 "Party Disagreements"
 BLK_party_disagreements_desc:0 "Our recent choices in how to allow our economy to recover has upset a number of people in our party, most notably the militarists, who are upset with our cuts of their budget. These voices have grown louder over time, and are already threatening to disrupt our party's control."
 BLK_talks_in_shadows:0 "Talks In Shadows"
 BLK_talks_in_shadows_desc:0 "Surprisingly, all the dissenting politicians and officials have quieted down, almost overnight. While this does make affairs easier for us, we can't help but shake the feeling that something suspicious is going on..."
 BLK_pull_the_trigger:0 "Pull The Trigger"
 BLK_pull_the_trigger_desc:0 "The time has come. The pacifist devils have crippled our military, the only thing we have, allowing foreign influence to creep in. We will clean house of these wolves, and restore Belka's strength before it is too late."
 BLK_nationalism_unleashed:0 "Nationalism Unleashed"
 BLK_nationalism_unleashed_desc:0 "There is no higher honor than to be a Belkan. Our people have forgotten this, and have gotten hung up on petty issues in our nation, tearing each other apart. We must remind them of who they are, and what it truly means to be Belkan."
 BLK_taking_off_the_kid_gloves:0 "Taking Off The Kid Gloves"
 BLK_taking_off_the_kid_gloves_desc:0 "Too many politicians are afraid of other nations, and strive to placate them to save their own skin. Not ours. We are not afraid to show the world our strength. They have more reason to fear us than we do to fear them."
 
 BLK_cult_of_belka:0 "The Cult Of Belka"
 BLK_cult_of_belka_desc:0 "What is Belka? A nation, some might say. But no. Nor is it a place, a government, or even a people. Belka is an idea. A concept, which we all must work towards creating. We will spread the word far and wide, that every citizen must do their part to reveal what Belka is in its truest form."
 BLK_police_state:0 "Enact Martial Law"
 BLK_police_state_desc:0 "Although we have control for now, it is inevitable that misguided people will come to oppose us. Enacting martial law will give us more control over the nation, and will severely stunt opposition efforts to foil our recovery."
 BLK_autarky:0 "Autarky Doctrine"
 BLK_autarky_desc:0 "If there is anything that the previous governments' experiences with trading with other nations has proved, is that they cannot be trusted. Why should we give them any resources when we know they will be used against us? From now on, all of Belka's resources belong to Belka, not any other nation."
 BLK_spirit_of_belkan_militarism:0 "An Army With A State"
 BLK_spirit_of_belkan_militarism_desc:0 "Going all the way back to the ancient Belkan Knights, Belka's existence has always been inseperable from the strength of its military. We must think less of the government as the controller of the military, but more as a guide for it. Most nations are states with armies, Belka is an army with a state."
 BLK_fortify_the_west:0 "Fortify The East"
 BLK_fortify_the_west_desc:0 "After the conservatives foolishly allowed parts of our nation to secede, they have now taken up arms against us. We will bring these lands back into their rightful place, but first we must prepare. Fortifying our border with them will give us a safe place to strike from."
 BLK_new_blood:0 "New Blood In The Leadership"
 BLK_new_blood_desc:0 "After going through this many divisions, our government is rather understaffed. Bringing in new, promising, and loyal people will strengthen our position, and help pave the way to Belka's future."
 BLK_women_in_industry:0 "Women In The Workforce"
 BLK_women_in_industry_desc:0 "It is wrong for us to put women onto the battlefield, endangering them. A much safer option that still allows women to contribute to our nation is by opening up industry positions for them, further bolstering our industrial capabilites."
 BLK_women_in_army:0 "Conscription Without Exception"
 BLK_women_in_army_desc:0 "Anyone who can hold a gun and follow orders is fit to serve in our army. The opportunity to fight for Belka is among the highest honor ever dreamed of, and it would be wrong to prevent anyone from partaking in it."
 BLK_gott_mit_uns:0 "Gott Mit Uns"
 BLK_gott_mit_uns_desc:0 "To thrive, every aspect of Belka must be united. We cannot allow for a multitude of faiths to control our people, there must be one truth preached to all our people, reminding them of our single united purpose. "
 BLK_excalibur:0 "Excalibur Project"
 BLK_excalibur_desc:0 "Excalibur, a long-range anti-missile laser defense system, has been in development for just over a decade now. It was nearly finished when the crisis occured and funding was cut. We will finish this program and protect our skies from missile attacks."
 BLK_form_bs:0 "Form BSF"
 BLK_form_bs_desc:0 "The Belkan Special Forces, elite divisions comprised of the best of the best, have been suggested by many people in the past, however were never successfully created. We will finally create them, serving as both an elite spearhead division for difficult operations, and as a symbol of Belka's might to the world."
 BLK_avalon:0 "Avalon Dam Project"
 BLK_avalon_desc:0 "Disguised as a simple hydroelectric dam, Avalon Dam is a high-tech testing facility as well as a launch site for ICBMs. Much like our other project, it was near completion when funding was cut. We will finish the facility and use it to continue research and development of cutting-edge military technology, before the lack of care allows someone to discover its true purpose."
 BLK_drill_the_army:0 "Loyalty Above All"
 BLK_drill_the_army_desc:0 "After filling our ranks, we need to instill a sense of duty in our new recruits. All soldiers, politicians, workers, everyone, will be taught from a young age that loyalty to Belka is the utmost priority. Nothing else comes close."
 BLK_unemployment:0 "Crush The Unemployment"
 BLK_unemployment_desc:0 "Many people in our nation are adrift, lacking cause or purpose, without any drive. Forcing anyone without a job into the arms production sector will give them a purpose and a sense of duty, as well as give them a productive use to our nation while significantly boosting our production."
 BLK_militarise_civilian_infr:0 "Militarise Civilian Infrastructure"
 BLK_militarise_civilian_infr_desc:0 "Many people are showing resistance to our new consription policy. We will show them that in Belka, the military is not just a force, it is a way of life. We will bring the military into all aspects of the civilian sector, showing them they cannot simply escape it."
 BLK_new_supply_dep:0 "Expand Supply Network"
 BLK_new_supply_dep_desc:0 "Our conscription policy has forced many people into the military, some of whom don't seem to want to be there. Rather than force them to fight against their will, we will open up opportunities for them to help in supplying the frontline, putting them in far less danger while still making use of them."
 BLK_overspending_on_military:0 "Fuel The Engines"
 BLK_overspending_on_military_desc:0 "The military and industrial companies are closely related to each other and increasing their cooperation is a guranteed way to keep them both strong and stable. Bringing the two together again will allow us to power our army like never before."
 BLK_military_industrial_complex:0 "Reawake Belkan Military Industrial Complex"
 BLK_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "The pacifists and other parties described the previous government as "overspending" on the military. The truth is, they were not spending enough on it. The military is the spirit and strength of Belka, and no price is high enough to keep it strong. We will restore the budget to its original state, empowering the military once again."
 BLK_quantity:0 "Quantity Ideas"
 BLK_quantity_desc:0 "The enemy nations seek to control Belka's people. If every man, woman and child in Belka were to fight back, not only would they prove a near impossible enemy to defeat, but the lack of controllable people would render any invasion pointless, giving us unique power over our enemies. We will allow anyone who wishes to serve the the ability to do so by arming the masses."
 BLK_quantity_2:0 "Use The Unusable"
 BLK_quantity_2_desc:0 "Even those who might be overlooked by society have a purpose to us. Criminals have signed away their rights, and as a result there is no harm in us placing them on the frontlines. The promise of freedom for service will prevent them from rebelling, as well as a constant watch on their actions."
 BLK_quality:0 "Quality Ideas"
 BLK_quality_desc:0 "Belkan knights were the pride of the ancient world for their discipline and courage. Rather than carelessly throw waves of men at the enemy, we will train and drill our soldiers to the core, reminding them of the legacy they carry. They will rival their ancient counterparts in their strength and glory."
 BLK_quality_2:0 "Belkan Assault Tactics"
 BLK_quality_2_desc:0 "Good doctrine is just as critical to success as good soliders are. Our old doctrines are getting rather outdated, and as a result we may suffer against advanced foes. Reforming our doctrine and keeping it fresh in our soldiers' minds will keep them alive, and strengthen their efficiency."
 BLK_infantry_focus:0 "The Backbone Of The Army"
 BLK_infantry_focus_desc:0 "No army in history ever had success from neglecting its infantry. The most versatile of any combat unit devised, if our army is mostly composed of infantry it makes sense to devote the most investments into the infantry as well."
 BLK_mech:0 "Develop The Support Core"
 BLK_mech_desc:0 "Anyone can raise a massive army of soldiers, but keeping those soldiers supplied, accounted for, and well prepared in the midst of combat is a much more difficult task. We will invest into developing support for our infantry so that they can fight at their best at all times."
 BLK_tank_focus:0 "To Smash Through"
 BLK_tank_focus_desc:0 "Tanks have proven their worth as the new cavalry, using quick, decisive strikes to disrupt and confuse the enemy. Improving our tank batallions will allow us to slice through enemy infantry with deadly precision, reminiscient of the old Belkan cavalry."
 BLK_armor:0 "Modernise Old Components"
 BLK_armor_desc:0 "Many wars have been fought on our soil, and as such we have a lot of old components lying around. Rather than building new ones from the ground up, analyzing and reusing old designs will let us improve our current ones much faster than we could otherwise."
 BLK_new_weapons:0 "Expand Weapons Research Groups"
 BLK_new_weapons_desc:0 "No single weapon can be left behind and expected to not be outpaced. Development of every single weapon we use must be contined to keep our army a cut above the rest of the world. Expanding our research budget and making individual groups for each weapon will keep it proceeding smoothly."
 BLK_tip_spear:0 "Leopard Project"
 BLK_tip_spear_desc:0 "In tanks, a balance between speed, power, and armor has always been a struggle. The Leopard Project seeks to find the perfect hybrid between these traits to create a new standard of tank."
 BLK_war_games:0 "War Games"
 BLK_war_games_desc:0 "With our army updated and improving, we will run a series of war games and studies to further improve our capabilities, as well as get our soldiers ready for the real thing."
 BLK_secure_fuel:0 "Secure Black Gold"
 BLK_secure_fuel_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of our war machine, and making sure we have enough is critical. Any industry that produces or processes oil must be taken to allow us to keep our nation safe."
 BLK_osean_front:0 "Prepare Osean Front"
 BLK_osean_front_desc:0 "Osea, our longtime rival, has humiliated us by taking our land and taking advantage of us. We will not stand for this humiliation. We will reclaim what is ours soon, but until then we must prepare for the coming conflict."
 BLK_contest_lakes:0 "Contest The Great Lakes"
 BLK_contest_lakes_desc:0 "Securing control of the Great Lakes would allow us to strike into the gateway to Osea proper, forcing them to pull back and giving us an advantage. It will not be easy though, as Osea currently posesses a greater navy than ours and holds more influence over the lakes than we do."
 BLK_dig_in:0 "Let Them Come"
 BLK_dig_in_desc:0 "Osea's main weakness is that any costly war will hurt the image of its political party, meaning they will not commit to an offensive unless there is a low risk to it. We can exploit this by fortifying ourselves at the border, forcing the Osean government to either lose domestic support in costly offensives, or play defensivley and give us the initiative to strike."
 BLK_naval_bomb:0 "Countering Osean Numbers"
 BLK_naval_bomb_desc:0 "Osea's massive fleet will be an extremely difficult opponent to topple. Rather than fight them in decisive battle, attacks from naval aircraft will likely be much cheaper and harass their fleet constantly, draining their resources to fight effectively."
 BLK_aa_air_ports:0 "Construct Aerial Infrastructure"
 BLK_aa_air_ports_desc:0 "In the war against Osea, no doubt will aerial combat prove critical, just as it did in the past. Constructing additional bases and support networks for aircraft should give us an edge against the Oseans in the air war."
 BLK_bunkers_lakes:0 "Schayne Line"
 BLK_bunkers_lakes_desc:0 "It is imperative that the Oseans and our eastern enemies cannot join together to combine armies. The Schayne Line is a proposed line of defenses across our southern tip that should serve as a strong defensive on both sides, making any push to unite the two fronts a highly difficult undertaking."
 BLK_build_up_navy:0 "Plan Z"
 BLK_build_up_navy_desc:0 "Although we may not be able to meet Osea's fleet power, our own navy is nowhere near powerful enough to fight back the Oseans, even with all the support. In the time we have left, building up our navy as much as possible should give us a fighting chance against them."
 BLK_scrap_the_navy:0 "Scrap The Navy"
 BLK_scrap_the_navy_desc:0 "The Belkan Navy has never been anything special, and seeing as there really isn't any use for it in the coming conflict, we may as well be better off scrapping it and using the materials to develop our ground forces."
 BLK_south_belka_munitions_monopoly:0 "South Belka Munitions"
 BLK_south_belka_munitions_monopoly_desc:0 "The South Belka Munitions Factory, at the foot of the Waldreich Mountains, has long been a world leader in weapons and aircraft research and development. Managing to survive the crisis, boosting their industries will give our airforce a much needed bolstering."
 BLK_to_cover_the_skyes:0 "Covering The Skies"
 BLK_to_cover_the_skyes_desc:0 "We are in an age where dominance over the skies determines the victor in warfare. Therefore, we must ensure that our own skies remain secure with an expansion of our air-defense network."
 BLK_crown_jewel:0 "The Crown Jewel"
 BLK_crown_jewel_desc:0 "Ever since its inception, the Belkan Air Force has been the pride of our nation. The first of its kind, the Belkan Air Force was created in 1907 during the Osean War. Compared to the Belkan Knights of old, our air force dutifully takes each task with pride and honor, setting a precedent for air forces across the globe."
 BLK_keep_skies_clear:0 "Focus On Superiority"
 BLK_keep_skies_clear_desc:0 "Air superiority has been the main job of our air force ever since its first days. Rather than being tied to the ground, our fighters fly best when they have no goal except to down the enemy by any means necessary, indirectly keeping our ground troops safe from any interference."
 BLK_fighter:0 "Keep Skies Clear"
 BLK_fighter_desc:0 "Routine patrols and large formation flying of our air force will ensure they are always ready for a fight and never caught off guard by enemy attacks. With complete air dominance, our ground troops will have an easy time pushing through the enemy lines."
 BLK_blast_them_to_kingdom_come:0 "Focus On Support"
 BLK_blast_them_to_kingdom_come_desc:0 "Cooperation between branches is important to victory, and as a result of this our air force's main job should be to assist the ground units with their objectives. Having more diverse units assigned to the same task will allow them to complement each other and have a higher chance of success."
 BLK_cas:0 "Blast Them To Kingdom Come"
 BLK_cas_desc:0 "Enemy tanks and installations prove to be a hard foe for other ground troops to take out, but are easy prey for our close air support. All it takes is a single spotting for an aircraft to take out even the hardest targets, keeping ground momentum moving."
 BLK_eyes_on_the_sky:0 "Eyes In The Sky"
 BLK_eyes_on_the_sky_desc:0 "Scout planes and spy planes can easily relay large amounts of info as well as sweep a whole area, providing large amounts of intel on enemy positions and operations. Their funding and development will allow us to keep a constant eye on our enemy."
 BLK_eyes_on_thr_ground:0 "Eyes On The Ground"
 BLK_eyes_on_thr_ground_desc:0 "Radio stations can be easily manned and monitored, letting us dot them all over our nation. At the first sign of enemy incursion, quick-response fighters can be sent out to deal with threats, making this an ideal solution in preserving our resources during a war."
 BLK_masters_of_the_craft:0 "Masters Of The Craft"
 BLK_masters_of_the_craft_desc:0 "Belkan aircraft are among the highest quality of their kind, and are highly prestigious in their field. We should capitalize off this and invest heavily into quality designs, both for their practical value and to build our reputation as the masters of the sky even further."
 BLK_scrap_the_graveyards:0 "Scrap The Graveyards"
 BLK_scrap_the_graveyards_desc:0 "Many scrapyards full of old or damaged aircraft exist around our nation, and could be repurposed to be used instead of fashioning new parts entirely. Their quality might leave a little to be desired, but we will be able to produce aircraft much quicker than before."
 BLK_bm_335_project:0 "Replacing Bm-335"
 BLK_bm_335_project_desc:0 "The Bm-355 Lindwurm bomber is the oldest plane in the Belkan Air Force, and while it has served us well over its 40 years of service, we are starting to fall short on bomber development and need to introduce a new bomber as our standard."
 
 BLK_dlp_war:0 "The Belkan War"
 BLK_dlp_war_desc:0 "Our operation to retake our rightful lands has begun. Worldwide, we are being demonized as imperialist and invasive, but we know in our hearts that every step forward is justified. Citing our actions as the fault, the world has dubbed our conflict as "The Belkan War.""
 BLK_to_the_last_man:0 "To The Last Soldier"
 BLK_to_the_last_man_desc:0 "Our soldiers have been trained well over the last few years, and now is the time for them to prove themselves. Our soldiers will stand bravely against any foe no matter how overwhelming, and each one will earn his name as a Belkan."
 BLK_repair_squads:0 "Repair Squads"
 BLK_repair_squads_desc:0 "Naturally, invading our former territory has caused some collateral damage to infrastructure and facilities, both from our attacks and resistance activity. Conscripting construction and civil workers from our invaded countries to repair these facilities will allow us to get them online faster."
 BLK_use_locals:0 "Secure What Was Ours"
 BLK_use_locals_desc:0 "It was not long ago when these lands were part of Belka, and many loyalists remain. Putting these people into management and command positions of their appropriate regions will allow us to stem the tide of resistance until the war is over, preventing us from being backstabbed."
 BLK_consript_workers:0 "Consript Factory Workers"
 BLK_consript_workers_desc:0 "The time for building is over, we need hands to fire guns, not make them. The front needs men, and if the factories have men, then they shall be taken. Factories can go empty, but if the front collapses we will be doomed."
 BLK_pillage_ustio:0 "Pillage Ustio"
 BLK_pillage_ustio_desc:0 "After the treacherous Oseans tricked us with their "resource company," extensive resources were found underneath Ustio. As Ustio is rightfully our land, it is natural that these resources belong to us, and will contribute to the war effort greatly."
 BLK_reparations:0 "Secure The North"
 BLK_reparations_desc:0 "We cannot hold the whole northeastern nations' territories and simutaneously invade the west, as doing so would stretch our army far too thin. After defeating formal resistance, establishing a loyalist puppet regime should allow us to reroute most of our troops to the western front."
 BLK_cross_great_lakes:0 "Great Lakes Offensive"
 BLK_cross_great_lakes_desc:0 "The Great Lakes only have a few narrow crossing points, and as such the fighting will be very dense and chaotic. Luckily, we used to own the territory, and as such have developed detailed tactical maps to assist our troops with this obstacle, giving them an edge over the Oseans. For a while, at least."
 BLK_schlacht_um_die_Zukunft:0 "Schlacht um die Zukunft"
 BLK_schlacht_um_die_Zukunft_desc:0 "Fighting Osea is more about fighting their people than their military. If we can drain them of hope with a staggering offense, forcing magnitudes of casualities, Osea's war support will plummet, putting us in a favorable position. Of course, this plan is not without it's drawbacks..."
 BLK_to_fuel_the_front:0 "Fueling The Front"
 BLK_to_fuel_the_front_desc:0 "As we advance forward, we must ensure our supplies advance with them. If we were to lose supply, our momentum would stop and our enemies could re-entrench. Designating new supply hubs in our occupied areas will allow us to continue fighting at full strength."

 BLK_plan_barghest_desc:0 "Our army got crushed and pushed back by continues onslaught of Osean Armor. But our spirit remains undefeated.

 BLK_plan_baobhan_sith:0 "Directive Baobhan Sith"
 BLK_plan_baobhan_sith_desc:0 "Before being crushed in the south, we were able to knock out the Northern Alliance. Sadly with this state of the war, this land lost any value to us and it's only tying down precius units as mere garrisons. We will reatreat all occupation forces from the area and send them to reinfirce our battered lines."
 BLK_plan_oberon:0 "Directive Oberon"
 BLK_plan_oberon_desc:0 "Lots of soldiers, in now hostile South Belka, found themselves on wrong side of the front due to treason of just few selected officers. They are still loyal to our government and would switch sides and first best oportunity. We need to show them that we did not abandoned them and their Fatherland still needs them. We need to strike hard into the souther lands to show everyone unity of Belka."
 BLK_to_hold_the_line:0 "The Last Order"
 BLK_to_hold_the_line_desc:0 "In an act of unprecedented defiance and miracle, we were somehow able to push back Allied Forces to borders from March 1995. This is as far as we can go. All that remains is to defend the land of our Fatherland to the last soldier - until we or Osea breaks.\nThis is last order to all still operational battlegroups in combat zones - hold the line."

 BLK_shatered_industry:0 "Shattered Industry"

 BLK_enforce_peace_requirements_desc:0 "Having lost the war, the Allied Forces have drawn up a list of requirements for our nation to abide by from the future.

However, the King has sworn that he plans to do all he can to restore Belka peacefully, and he seems to have the faith of the people behind him."

 BLK_war_won:0 "The Triumph Of Belka"
 BLK_war_won_desc:0 "The Belkan War was called what it was because of the world's labelling of us as warmongers, as invaders, as the enemy of the fight. However, when historians talk about the conflict, it will be called the Belkan War, named after it's victors. How ironic it is that the label pressed upon us to demonize us has become a symbol of victory."
 BLK_celebration:0 "The Great Celebration"

 BLK_rald_speech_desc:0 "Waldemarr Rald has prepared a speech to the people for the victory celebration, a speech showing not only did he keep his promises to the Belkan people, but also unveiling his greater plans for the future of Belka. Belka is a lighhouse, and Rald is her light."
 BLK_belka_above_all:0 "Our Undefeated Spirit"
 BLK_belka_above_all_desc:0 "Critical to our soldiers' training was instilling a sense of duty and pride to be Belkan in them.

 BLK_army_stands_undefeated_desc:0 "The troops that survived the war are no doubt the best of the best by this point, and are the prime subjects for studying the war and better improving our tactics and battlefield decision-making.

 BLK_exhausted_army:0 "Exhausted Troops"
 BLK_exhausted_army_desc:0 "As of right now, no great military threat to us exists on this continent, other than resistance from our own territories.

 BLK_new_land_to_occupy_desc:0 "While it was not long occupied, many of the former territories have been altered one way or another by the rebellious governments.

 BLK_demob_economy_desc:0 "During the war, every business and industry was roped into directly supporting the armed forces, rather than the civilian population.

 BLK_home_repair_plan_desc:0 "Both our core and newly regained lands have suffered immensely as a result of the war, and would take an extremely long amount of time to repair.

 ### EVENTS ###
 ##############
 
 belka.1.t:0 "Nation In Pieces"
 belka.1.d:0 "Our nation is in pain. The continued overspending on the military has wrecked our economy, which in turn has caused businesses to downsize, laying off workers, making them spend less, further drying up economic growth, causing company after company to close their doors. Without the goods and services offered by many of these companies, it has gotten harder and harder for our citizens to source food, pay bills, or provide for their families. This, in turn, has caused drastically increased radicalization and polarization of our populace, who turn to radical idealisms as their only hope of change. Even worse, due to our nation being in this state for quite some time, even our resources in the government are now beginning to run thin."
 belka.1.a:0 "God Save Belka."
 
 belka.2.t:0 "People On The Streets"
 belka.2.d:0 "The scope of the protests is far greater than we ever imagined. Nearly every day has some kind of major protest happening somewhere in our country, and crimes have also seen exponential growth compared to when this all began. Masses of people are calling for all sorts of demands, from more reform programs all the way to calls for outright revolution. The silver lining in this is that the sheer mass of protesters makes them unable to unite or organize effectively, making them less of a threat than an organized group. Regardless, this will only buy us some time, as if we continue to leave this issue unresolved they will no doubt find a way to organize."
 belka.2.a:0 "They just need to wait a little longer."
 
 belka.3.t:0 "Economy Long Gone"
 belka.3.d:0 "Our economy has had negative growth for over a year now, and the effects are extremely obvious. The vast majority of our nation lives below the poverty line, as the middle class has been all but obliterated. More than half of the small businesses in the country have closed, and about a third of the large businesses went bankrupt or were bought out. International companies and investors saw the writing on the wall long ago and have left for greener pastures, meaning there's no external group we can use to leverage ourselves back onto our feet. Worst of all, now our own funds in the government have begun to dry up, and we've had to downsize our own government and print larger amounts of currency to offset our expenses. However, even that is wearing thin and the inflation is devaluing our money faster than we can print enough to compensate it."
 belka.3.a:0 "We just have to keep printing."
 
 belka.4.t:0 "Mass Exodus"
 belka.4.d:0 "Unemployment is only the tip of the iceberg. Workers, scientists, doctors, lawyers, even our own officials are emigrating to other countries to find work, and at an alarming rate. The lack of job opportunities in Belka is causing workers to look elsewhere, even outside their home country, to provide for their families. Some are even taking their families with them. Houses run empty and border checkpoints are crowded as people scramble to exit the country. Not only have we lost our workforce, but we will be unable to recover them if we cannot stop this outflow of people. If this keeps up, there won't even be a Belka to revive."
 belka.4.a:0 "Close the borders!"
 
 belka.5.t:0 "Complete Collapse"
 belka.5.d:0 "It appears, ironically, that our last efforts to take inventory on the crisis pushed us over the tipping point. Our budget this month was unable to meet the expenses, and as a result we, as a nation, are in complete bankruptcy. As our officials find out, many are simply getting up and leaving. We are completely powerless and at the whims of whatever the future brings. The only influence we have is off goodwill alone, and that will not get us far. The future is dark."
 belka.5.a:0 "Just when we were getting started."
 
 belka.6.t:0 "Government Falls Apart"
 belka.6.d:0 "The word is out. The jig is up. Everyone knows about the state of the government, and almost everyone in any position of power has either been forced out or simply walked out. Belka is in a state of anarchy. It is impossible to even tell what is happening in the country because all sources of information we could use is gone or takes orders from someone new now. Dinsmark is empty."
 belka.6.a:0 "What will become of us?"
 
 belka.7.t:0 "New Elections, New Rule"

Osea has even expressed that they would be willing to lease many of the resources in the area to us through a joint resource excavation company. Some in the government are suspicious of this deal, since it's unlikley that Osea would offer us such a deal without a clear benefit to them, but others are hopeful that it could be the beginning of a new era of cooperation between our nations, as well as our lifeline to save our nation.

The designs have changed slightly since the original proposed design from 1981, however the core design has remained mostly unchanged. These designs have allowed us to make the design more modular, including swappable lenses for different ranges and targets, as well as heat transferring pipes to allow the main structure to assist in cooling as well as the six primary cooling towers. This also has allowed for possible future improvements on the design, but for now we have a simple choice to make on where to invest the last of the project's leftover budget. We could develop an electronic targeting system that syncs up with radar data, allowing Excalibur to easily target agile objects like aircraft, boosting our air superiority capabilities. We could even invest in a denser power system, allowing the laser to reach higher temperatures and give it the ability to assist in ground attacks. Or we could simply keep it to its original purpose and improve its ICBM destruction capabilities."

However, now that this facility has been completed, we must make sure it stays secure. While we could keep the garrison the same as any other military installation, to avoid suspicion, the criticality of the projects being worked on presents a high risk. We could station the former head of Project Pendragon as well as a top ace in the Belkan Air Force, Dr. Anton Kupchenko, head of the "Gault Squadron" at the base, where he could assist in both research and security, as the projects worked on there will likely be continuations of his own work. Alternatively, we could also station the newly-formed Belkan Special Forces at the facility, while this would not allow the research benefits the BSF will likely have a much tighter hold on the facility, making it much more secure, as well as ensure that the BSF will be the first to recieve any new high-tech infantry weapons developed on-site."

To combat this, Waldemarr Rald has decided to declare the United Church of Belka, to ensure that the church does not teach dissenting thoughts against the state. This new organization will need a leader from the religious sector that will not be seen as a mere puppet. The three best possible candidates have been presented to Rald, and we now await his answer. Father Hannes Kellermann, head of the Church of Dinsmark, has been an outspoken loyalist of the DLP and while he was originally supportive of the pacifist wing of the party, has since come around and speaks extremely positively of Rald. He may not be very useful aside from his high charisma and undying loyalty, but the church will never be an issue as long as he is around. Opposite of him is Father Arnold Weinmann, a leading figure in the Lumen Cathedral, originally a member of the Alternative Wege, but reluctantly changed to the DLP after accusations of Osean sympathies. He is not an Osean sympathizer, however he greatly prefers the pacifist wing of the DLP, and has yet to endorse Rald publicly, making his loyalty questionable. Despite that, he used to work as an economist during the military build-up several years ago, and likely could be of use in that area, assisting with our own build-up. Finally, we have Father Wilfried Jan Riese von Sergio Luoni, a former bishop from Hoffnung, who was removed from position after declaring many sects as heretical and claiming only he had the true interpretation of the Scriptures. He has since been excommunicated, but leads a small cult-like following in Sudentor, mostly popular with lower-class people and occultists. He is a wild card, loyalty unknown and likely would not serve any extra benefits, however his leadership would keep the Church far from government affairs, as it would be too busy fighting itself to make any targeted effort agains the government."

It all started after an unprecedented economic crisis hit Belka a decade earlier, leading to territorial concessions and a desperate population to seek hope and revenge in a far-right, militarist party, who used all Belka's remaining economic might to wage war against Ustio, a country that recently seceded and found enormous amounts of resources.\n\nThus, Belka declared war on all surrounding countries in a last-ditch attempt to gain supremacy in the Osean continent and regain all lost territories. After an initial setback, the attacked countries formed an alliance that counterattacked and pushed back Belkan forces, expoliting the inability of Belkan state to sustain equipment losses. With rumors, later confirmed, of Belka developing weapons of mass destruction, Allied forces continued to penetrate Belkan lands leading to the secession of the southern part of the nation, until the Belkan government, in a desperate attempt to save the northern part of the country, launched a nuclear attack along the Waldreich Mountains on June 6th, 1995.\n\nSeeing the insanity unfold, the Allies accepted Belka's sue for peace resulting in the peace conference of Lumen of June 20th."

 belka_dlp_war.101.d:0 "A humiliating peace deal, but it allows our survival. The negotiations, signed in Lumen yesterday, cede the entirety of the demilitarized South Belka to Osea, finally completing their century-long conquest of the Great Lakes. While we are forced to return the territory we sold to the eastern nations, they do not gain any new territory, and South Belka is our only territorial loss. However, this is more than made up in the enormous quantity of reparations owed to all nations involved, despite our already pitiful economic state. To add insult to injury, massive limitations have been placed on our pride, the Belkan Armed Forces, limiting our soldiers, equipment, and research capabilities. If that wasn't enough, Osea will not return any companies, factories, or any kind of value in South Belka to us, leaving us even less tools to rebuild. Despite this extreme humiliation and defeat, we have managed to conceal the existence of the Avalon Dam facility as well as our remaining nuclear stockpile. Debate now remains on if we should use these weapons to enact a final revenge on Osea, even if it causes our demise, or using these tools to maintain our independence as we enter the next era. With the debates still ongoing, the future is unsure, but at last, war is over for now."

With nothing left that can easily topple us, we are now free to pursue any claims or injustices we wish to rectify.

Unable to reinforce in these cities, we have been forced to retreat, begrudgingly allowing the Osean Army to move through these territories unimpeded. While not shattering, this is a major setback and represents a large portion of our country effectively taken over by the enemy, which we will now have to reclaim. We have already prepared defensive positions in the north and are drafting new battle plans, even some rather extreme ones.

Our shortsightedness and timidity has doomed the Fatherland. Now Osea and her dogs are barking at the gates and our cities burn because of our foolish mistake in letting those mixed breeds fester in their treason and cowardice.

Sapin has pulled back with them, the casualties on it's military leaving it compromised and even more reliant on the Oseans than before.

It lasted until dusk, after which the bands played their traditional signal of the day ending and the soldiers returned to their stations. The parade has seen extensive coverage by media both local and international, and while most local media outlets were impressed and pleased to see the soldiers return home, many of the international reporters condemn the parade as "imperialist" and claim our actions give no reason for celebration.

We have also proved our might to the world, that the Belkans are a forced to be reckoned with, through our defeat and humiliation of the Osean forces. The Oseans are not the lords of the world they thought they were, and we will not dance to their music.

Rather than being granted regional independence like the Gebetians and Rectans, a combination of their betrayal and the newly discovered resource deposits have led us to fully annex their lands instead. The steel deposits will be used to bolster our own mining operations, and the precious uranium caches will allow us to continue nuclear research, become a profitable export, and possibly develop more powerful superweapons. The downside to this is that the Ustians, whom have always been highly resistant to our rule, only become more radicalized by our annexation, and even thought their army was defeated news is coming in of terror attacks and partisan strikes up and down the territory. It will likely be a long time before we can fully pacify and integrate these lands once again."

 belka_dlp_won.8.t.a:0 "Excalibur Remains Secret."
 belka_dlp_won.8.d.a:0 "Because of our proficiency in the war, Excalibur never had to be used to assist us, continuing to keep it's existence a secret. It remains as an anti-ICBM facility in the event of a suprise attack against us, however now with our additional resources and time, we will likely be able to upgrade Excalibur beyond it's original purpose, also extending it's operational range, potentially even using it as a offensive weapon. The lack of use has allowed the facility to stay in tip-top shape without major efforts being put forward to maintain it."
 belka_dlp_won.8.t.b:0 "Excalibur Is A Success"
 belka_dlp_won.8.d.b:0 "The use of Excalibur against our enemies, while revealing it's existence and purpose, was critical in the war effort and it is very clear that it was well worth the effort. With the war now over, and new resources and time on our hands, the potential to upgrade the weapon far past it's initial expectations is beginning to come within our reach. Using the operational data from the war, we know exactly where it's strengths and weaknesses lie, and will be able to work around this information to our advantage."
 belka_dlp_won.8.t.c:0 "Rebuilding Excalibur?"
 belka_dlp_won.8.d.c:0 "While the destruction of Excalibur was unfortunate, its limited time in operation combined with the effort expended by the Oseans to destroy it has given us a sizable base of knowledge on how to improve on the first design. While the first tower is completely unsalvageable aside from the cooling towers and some of the base components, the site itself is still very usable and while it still will take a large effort to rebuild it, it will still go faster than a complete rebuild in a new location. That, combined with what we learned, will ensure the second Exalibur does not end the same way as the first."

 belka_dlp_won.9.t:0 "The Tower That Shines At The End Of The World"
 belka_dlp_won.9.a:0 "Truly a king's weapon."
 belka_dlp_won.9.d:0 "While we knew Excalibur could be further upgraded, upon hearing our engineers' reports, the possibilities are nearly endless. Since Excalibur uses chemical lasers projected off of satellites, if we keep adding more of these satellites into orbit, we could keep on increasing the range until a series of refractors could carry it all across the globe, allowing us to strike any position at nearly any time. On top of that, a new theorized staggered cooling system and dynamic mechanized lenses would drastically increase it's fire rate and accuracy. With this weapon, it would not be too far-fetched to call us the masters of the world, as we could theoretically call down the fist of God himself to smite all who oppose our reign. That is, of course, still a long way off, and provided we can keep the tower functioning and in our hands during that time period."
