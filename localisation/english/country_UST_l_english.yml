 ### FOCUSES ###
 UST_start:0 "Free Once Again"
 UST_start_desc:0 "The nation of Ustio has been under the control and occupation of Belka for over a century. However, in 1988 the Belkan Federal Law Review finally allowed our nation to be free again. With this in mind, the coming year is full of hope for us as we re-assert ourselves."
 UST_tyran_industry:0 "Expand Tyrann Industry "
 UST_tyran_industry_desc:0 "Tyrann, one of our easternmost cities, has lots of flat, undeveloped land ripe for industrialization. To help kickstart our economy, it would be wise to invest into more factories and infrastructure in the area."
 UST_connect_miedzyrzecz:0 "Connect Solis Ortus"
 UST_connect_miedzyrzecz_desc:0 "Solis Ortus, a somewhat isolated town on our southern border, is a important location in the Tyrann Mountains. Improving transportation to and from the town will help us in connecting our nation as a whole."
 UST_pay_for_museum:0 "Finance The Museum"
 UST_pay_for_museum_desc:0 "Under Belkan rule, we were forbidden and restricted from many of our traditions, as well as major parts of Ustian history were censored. To ensure our history is not forgotten, we will construct a large and impressive museum as a tribute to the enduring history and spirit of Ustio."
 UST_upgrade_schooling_system:0 "Upgrade Schooling System"
 UST_upgrade_schooling_system_desc:0 "Our school system is still heavily built on Belkan curriculum and education policies. Distancing ourselves from this will ensure the next generation will not be taught Belkan lies."
 UST_ratio_military_bases:0 "East Military Bases"
 UST_ratio_military_bases_desc:0 "Belka has established a number of forts and defenses on our eastern border. While now defunct, rebuilding and retrofitting these will be far less expensive than attempting to build entirely new ones."
 UST_anti_partisant_training:0 "Anti-Partisan Training"
 UST_anti_partisant_training_desc:0 "Our eastern territories are primarily Ratian by culture, and as a result many partisans are rebelling against our government and causing attacks in the region. Until a more permanent solution can be achieved, we must work to stop the spread of violence."
 
 UST_deal:0 "Deal With Ratio"
 UST_deal_desc:0 "The lands of Tyrann and Boikos do not belong to us. Their rightful owner, Ratio, had them stolen away by Belka some time ago. However, the Ratians have proven themselves a trustworthy people and friendly to us, and it would be both and wrong and futile to lay claim to their lands. They have offered to purchase their lands from us for a number of wonderful benefits, and we happily accept."
 UST_no_step_on_our_land:0 "Not A Single Step On Our Land"
 UST_no_step_on_our_land_desc:0 "The Ratians believe they deserve some sort of right to our lands, now that the Belkans have withdrawn from them. Ustian blood was spilled for this soil, and it is us who have fought to preserve and develop it. We will prove to the Ratians that these lands are Ustian, and will always be."
 
 UST_promised_payment:0 "Promised Payments"
 UST_promised_payment_desc:0 "As a show of good faith, the Ratian government has paid us a generous sum of money in exchange for the territories sold to them. This, combined with lowered expenses from less territory, will help us greatly in developing our core land for the next year."
 UST_resetle_the_people:0 "Resettle The People"
 UST_resetle_the_people_desc:0 "A clause of the agreement with Ratio is that any Ustian citizens from the lands sold to Ratio who wish to remain in Ustio will be freely allowed to re-immigrate into our nation, with Ratio paying for most of the expenses. As the people begin to trickle in, we will do our part in resettling them quickly and efficiently back into our country."
 UST_move_part_of_industry:0 "Move The Industry"
 UST_move_part_of_industry_desc:0 "Factories, businesses, and other improvements build by Ustio have been allowed to move back into our country after Ratio purchased the land they existed on, as a clause of the agreement between us. They have all packed their things and prepared for the move, and now it is our turn to make sure they are resettled easily and can reopen as soon as possible."
 UST_mid_1992:0 "1992 Elections"
 UST_mid_1992_desc:0 "With the domestic issues at hand mostly resolved, the people's minds have turned to the upcoming election between the incumbent Grzegorz Naruszewicz and his main opposition, Kuba Morkawiecki. Currently, Naruszewicz has a large lead, but in the time between now and the election, anything could change that."
 
 UST_grzegorz_wins:0 "Naruszewicz Victory"
 UST_grzegorz_wins_desc:0 "Grzegorz Naruszewicz, the "Father of Ustio," has secured another term for his government, proving extremely popular to the nation for his unwavering commitment to the nation's future. Though he is wishing to retire, he is committed to ensuring Ustio is strong and ready to face the future before he does so."
 UST_father_continues_his_rule:0 "Father Continues His Rule"
 UST_father_continues_his_rule_desc:0 "The first leader of our nation, and a strong supporter of our independence before that, Naruszewicz is a figure respected by many, even some of his opponents.

 ### EVENTS ###
 
 ustio.1.t:0 "Offer from Ratio"
 ustio.1.d:0 "Following our recent acquisition of territory from Belka, our eastern neighbor of Ratio has approached us with a deal. The lands of Tyrann and Boikos are primarily Ratian in culture, as they were relatively recently conquered from them by Belka. Even after falling under our control in the Belkan Federal Law Review of 1988, Ratio has never renounced their claim on the lands, however they appear to be far friendlier to us than Belka. They have offered a deal to purchase the lands back from us for a generous price, far exceeding the actual value of the territories. This, combined with several clauses allowing us to move Ustian assets out of the land and into our core areas, and a parnership with our nation for future cooperations. This deal appears to be extremely beneficial for us, as in addition to the obvious monetary benefits, we have had extensive trouble dealing with partisan forces in the area, and as a relatively new nation in the world, the presence of another ally would be greatly valued. The only protest against this deal has come from Franek Dolas, who argues that we have spent extensive resources on the lands, and even if it was under Belkan leadership, many Ustians fought and died to conquer the land. As he argues, the strongest nation will be the one who succeeds, first it was Belka, and when they were proven weak, we rose to that position instead, and if Ratio thinks they should have the land they will need to prove their strength over us to obtain it. Aside from his ramblings, the advisory board is unanimous that this deal should be taken."
