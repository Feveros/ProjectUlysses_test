 yuktobania_fp.1.t: "The Belkan War"
 yuktobania_fp.1_desc: "War has broken out on the Osean continent between the Belkan Federation and the Osean Federation. Though the Oseans are out primary geopolitical rival, the Belkans are no angels either. They are, objectively, more diametrically opposed to us politically after all.\n\nIf we do not intervene, it would, at best for us, result in both Dinsmark and Oured bloodying their noses while we grow our strength. At worst for us, the Belkans win a decisive victory and we have a new geostrategic rival to deal with. One far more militarist and nationalistic than even the most hawkish Osean.\n\nIf we intervene, it will result in Yuktobania boots on the ground and pilots in the air in Osea. It will cost us a lot of resources but could result in a strong showing of Yuktobanian military prowess along with lowering the chance of a Belkan victory. However, if the Oseans lose anyway, it would be a great embarassment for us and we will have to deal with a strong Belka."
 yuktobania_fp.1.a: "Intervention is worth the risk"
 yuktobania_fp.1.b: "Let them bleed each other dry"
