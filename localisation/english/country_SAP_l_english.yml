 sap_1991_parliamentary_elections_desc: "The 1991 Sapinish parliamentary elections will be extremely pivotal for our nation's future as it's the first election since the constitutional reform in 1990. Will the Republicans win and steer the country towards democracy, making everyone more equal in the process, or will the old guard rein in the reform and bring back the "good old days?""
 sap_1991_republican_victory: "Republican Victory"

 sap_reinforce_state_secularism: "Reinforce State Secularism"

 sap_rein_in_the_church: "Rein In The Church"
 sap_rein_in_the_church_desc: "The Catholic Church has enjoyed great privilege over the course of Sapin's history. While we will allow for people to join and practice its faith, we need to rein in its control over national politics and governance."

 sap_establish_a_public_school_system_desc: "For years, Sapin's education has relied on a system of private and Church-run schools, with the only government-backed educational institutes being military academies.

We will recommend the progressive aristocrat Domingo Escalona as Crown Regent."
 sap_increase_taxes_on_nobility: "Increase Taxes On The Nobility"
 sap_increase_taxes_on_nobility_desc: "The nobility has enjoyed the privilege of little to no taxation for centuries, leading to most of the historic tax burdens being shifted to the poor of the country.

 sap_increase_social_spending: "Increase Social Spending"
 sap_increase_social_spending_desc: "Sapin has historically not had very strong government-backed social programs. Most forms of "public service" were carried out through the Catholic Church which, while effective, allowed for individual churches to turn away people at a whim based on personal bias and bigotry.

 sap_our_friends_in_oured_desc: "Oured has been one of our strongest and oldest allies in the Osean continent, being known to throw its weight around to assist us when needed so long as we help them in turn.

 sap_north_osean_treaty_organization_desc: "Though our alliance with Oured has been beneficial, it's time for us to go our own way and forge our own path in the world. We'll begin by establishing our own security treaty in Northern Osea for collective defense against any invader of the region."
 sap_our_perbla_position: "Our Perbla Position"
 sap_our_perbla_position_desc: "Our relationship with Perbla has been complicated as of late. For centuries, the royal houses of both nations have intermingled and enjoy amicable relations.

 sap_reform_the_high_command_desc: "The Sapinish military high command has been plagued with issues for decades. Being largely made up of aristocrats and nobles, appointed mostly through personal connections, the army high command is plagued with incompetence and nepotism.

 sap_promote_public_austerity_desc: "To help ride through the storm of the current economic crisis, we must promote public austerity to the people of Sapin. Advising them on ways to conserve their money as much as possible until the economy rebounds."

 sapin_politics.12.desc: "[ROOT.GetLeader] gave a speech in the nation's parliament today, with the intention of uniting the legislture to address Sapin's issues and stabilize the government. It seemed to be effective, as the legislature responded with applause and the speech was well-recieved by the public."
 sapin_politics.12.a: "Finally, some good news"
 sapin_politics.13.t: "Extremist MP Censured"
 sapin_politics.13.desc: "It seems that one of the extremist members of parliament was too extreme, even for their own party, as they've just been censured by a majority vote of the parliament. Hopefully, this will mean less disruptions in parliament and overall less extremism."
 sapin_politics.13.a: "Let's see how it turns out"
 # Major Events
 sapin.1.t: "Prince Of Sapin Comes Of Age"
 sapin.1.desc: "The Prince of Sapin, [ROOT.GetLeader] has finally come of age to take the crown of Sapin and is now able to take responsibility as the new King of Sapin.\n\nMany Sapiniards are concerned about the ability of the young king to take control, especially after the circumstances of his regency, but the regent has told the press they believe that he's ready for the job."
 sapin.1.a: "Long live the king!"
 # Diplomacy
 sapin_diplomacy.1.t: "The Ustio-Ratio Situation"
 sapin_diplomacy.1.desc: "To the north of us, a conflict is brewing between the Ratio and the nascent Ustio. The conflict is rooted in a dispute between the two nations over a chunk of Ustian land containing many ethnic Ratians, whom the Ratian govenrment believes to be oppressed by the Ustian govenrment. Ustio disputes such claims and argues that it has a right to its own territorial sovereignty."
 sapin_diplomacy.1.a: "We should side with Ustio"
 sapin_diplomacy.1.b: "We should side with Ratio"
 sapin_diplomacy.2.t: "[FROM.GetName] Sides With Us!"
 sapin_diplomacy.2.desc: "The [FROM.GetName] has informed us that they've chosen to back our side in the territorial dispute over the Tyrann Valley. They've given us not only diplomatic, but military support as the news was delivered along with a shipment of weapons."
 sapin_diplomacy.2.a: "Excellent news!"
 sapin_diplomacy.3.t: "The Belka Problem"
 sapin_diplomacy.3.desc: "To the northwest of us is a looming threat: Belka. The militarist nation and its ability to exert an extreme amount of hard power on the Osean continent has been an ever-present danger to us and other North Osean nations. Historically, however, the Belkans have not had a strong Osea to fight and we might finally have a chance at putting an end to the Belkan menace.\n\nOn the other hand, the Belkans have been known to pull through even at the most unexpected times and siding with the Oseans might result in our own destruction in the long-term."
 sapin_diplomacy.3.a: "We need to end the Belkan threat"
 sapin_diplomacy.3.b: "Peace might be better for us long-term"
 sapin_diplomacy.4.t: "[FROM.GetName] Forgoes Futuro Claims"
 sapin_diplomacy.4.desc: "The [FROM.GetName] has formally announced to us and to their own populace that they've decided to forgoe their claims on the disputed territory of Futuro in a broader effort to normalize relations between our two countries."
 sapin_diplomacy.4.a: "One less possible threat"
 sapin_diplomacy.5.t: "Our Friends In Oured"
 sapin_diplomacy.5.desc: "The Oseans have been a strong ally of ours for ages, both thanks to aligning interests and to our mutual benefit from the amount of trade going between each others' ports. As we approach the turn of the century, many of our foreign policy establishment has been concerned about Osea's pivot towards focusing on Yuktobania and Verusa rather than the Belkans here in northern Osea. In the future, it might be the case that the Oseans will be too distracted to help us against the Belkans and we might need to consider forming our own alliance to fight a possible Belkan invasion with."
 sapin_diplomacy.5.a: "We will stand by our historic ally"
 sapin_diplomacy.5.b: "We must go on our own path"
 sapin_diplomacy.6.t: "Sapin Announces Military Exercise With Osea"
 sapin_diplomacy.6.desc: "The Sapinish Royal Army has announced plans to participate in a joint Sapinish-Osean military exercise to help bolster both nations' military readiness and discipline.\n\nBoth nations seem hopeful about the upcoming exercises as Sapinish military personnel land in Osea to begin. The spokesperson for the Osean Defense Forces has stated the maneuvers will be dubbed "OSAP [GetYear].""
 sapin_diplomacy.6.a: "Great news!"
 sapin_diplomacy.7.t: "Sapin Announces Independent Foreign Policy"
 sapin_diplomacy.7.desc: "Sapin has announced that it is planning to readjust its foreign policy to be more independent from foreign influence, due to changing times in the world. Part of its announcement included some signalling that it might look to create its own defensive pact in Northern Osea for the purposes of collective North Osean security without being subject to the whims of Osea, Yuktobania, or Belka."
 sapin_diplomacy.7.a: "This isn't good"
 sapin_diplomacy.8.t: "Formation Of NOTO"
 sapin_diplomacy.8.desc: "The [FROM.GetName] has announced the formation of the North Osean Treaty Organization (NOTO) as an independent military alliance designed for the collective security of North Osea.\n\nThis is a sharp turn away from traditional Sapinish policy, which has always been in favor of close ties between Sapin and Osea due to the nations' aligned interests and shared trade. Such a move suggests Sapin might not trust in Osea's ability to adequately protect Sapin and North Osea or possibly even Sapin's desire to be a major world player in its own right."
 sapin_diplomacy.8.a: "Interesting Development"
 sapin_diplomacy.8.b: "Those little rats"
 sapin_diplomacy.9.t: "Joining NOTO?"
 sapin_diplomacy.9.desc: "A Sapinish delegation has arrived in our capital offering for us membership in the newly-created North Osean Treaty Organization. Should we join, we'd lose a lot of positive relations with Osea and Belka but would be entering a greater North Osean defensive pact."
 sapin_diplomacy.9.a: "We shall join"
 sapin_diplomacy.9.b: "We respectfully decline"
 sapin_diplomacy.10.t: "Our Perbla Position"
 sapin_diplomacy.10.desc: "The Kingdom of Perbla in southern Osea is a sort of "Hermit Kingdom," mostly diplomatically isolated from the rest of the world aside from some lukewarm relations with Belka due to their hostile foreign policy. In spite of this, Perbla is a bastion of the "Ancient Regime," a monarchy that clings to the same values that our state was founded on."
 sapin_diplomacy.10.a: "They are a menace"
 sapin_diplomacy.10.b: "They are a fellow monarchy"
 sapin_diplomacy.11.t: "Our Border Policy"
 sapin_diplomacy.11.desc: "Sapin is known as being a nation historically friendly to immigration and being a nation that many North Oseans desire to move to to find better opportunities. In recent years, however, more nationalist elements of Sapinish politics have created this notion that immigrants from North Osea could be secret Belkan agents trying to undermine Sapin's national security and those who aren't are stealing jobs from hardworking Sapiniards. Attempting to address this issue, the Sapinish government has tried to tighten immigration restrictions without being too restrictive. However, this has just caused pro-immigration activists to be upset with the Sapinish government without fully placating the other side. As the head of the country, [ROOT.GetLeader] can make a royal decree addressing this issue."
 sapin_diplomacy.11.a: "Loosen our immigration restrictions"
 sapin_diplomacy.11.b: "Tighten our immigration restrictions"
 sapin_civil_war.1.t: "Republican Revolt"
 sapin_civil_war.1.desc: "Dissatisfied with the Sapinish government's right-wing policies, the more radical elements of Sapin's Republican movement have taken up arms against the Sapinish government, proclaiming the creation of a Sapinish Republic to create the egalitarian society they desire."
 sapin_civil_war.1.a: "Put this rabble down!"
 sapin_civil_war.1.b: "They might have a point (Play as Republicans)"
 sapin_civil_war.2.t: "Nationalist Revolt"
 sapin_civil_war.2.desc: "Dissatisfied with the Sapinish government's left-wing policies, the more radical elements of Sapin's nationalist movement have taken up arms against the Sapinish government, proclaiming their desire to restore Sapin's traditional society."

 sapin_civil_war.2.b: "Long live Old Sapin (Play as Nationalists)"
