 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Ring Of Time"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The world holds its breath as it prepares to enter the 21st century, just as it did at the beginning of the last, repeating the infinite ring of time. The decades-long Cold War between Osea and Yuktobania continues despite recent developments, as does a standoff between Erusean and UTO forces in western Usea, and an unstable Belka threatens to fall into chaos, allowing powerful weapons to fall into possibly wrong hands. The world is on the brink of what could be the new greatest conflict known to mankind. Without beginning or end, the ring stretches into the infinite."
 
 BLK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "£GFX_map_belka_map\nA nation with deep roots in its military, Belka has never found itself far from using force to achieve it's goals. After seeing the meteoric rise of its rival, Osea, Belka has sought to not let itself be outpaced. Excessive military spending has allowed the nation to stay a relevant power on the world stage, at the sacrifice of its economy, and most of it's domestic stability. Confidence in the government has reached all-time lows, and many people feel that new leadership and new direction is needed. With radical movements both old and new on the rise, the lack of ability to predict the future of this old northern hegemon is a terrifying reality."
 
 OSE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "£GFX_map_osea_map\nThe largest nation on Earth, the world superpower Osea sits at a decisive moment in its history. A newer nation than its neighbors, the rapid growth of Osea over the past century has only been curbed by two things: The Cold War thrust upon it by its ideological rival, the Union of Yuktobanian Republics, and it's strategic rival, the Belkan Federation. Despite this, the greatest threats to Osea seems to come from within. The two dominant political parties, the Unity Party and Liberty Party, have traded blows for a century, constantly seeking to one-up the other. Threatened both internally and externally, Osea must unite if she is to survive the 21st century."
 
 UST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "£GFX_map_ustio_map\nAfter many years of occupation, the nation of Ustio is reborn. Annexed by Belka more than a century ago, Ustio has always preserved an independent culture from their occupiers, with eventual dreams of independence. Those dreams came true in 1988, with the ratification of the Belkan Federal Law Review, allowing Ustio to assert it's own independence from Belka. Finally liberated, now the endless task of staying independent has begun. With the world growing ever more dangerous by the day, Ustio must fight with every ounce of strength she has to not fall again, not to Belka, not to Osea, not to any nation."
 
 GEB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "£GFX_map_gebet_map\nRecently refounded after the Belkan Federal Law Review of 1988 allowed the nation to secede from the Belkan Federation, the Confederation of Gebet struggles to assert itself against the turbulent political landscape of Osea. Having been reliant on Belka for much of recent history, many echoes of the Belkan Economic Crisis affect Gebet just as much as Belka, carving a difficult task for its leadership. Aside from this, more nationalistic Belkans make no effort to hide their disdain for the 1988 act, and wish for Gebet to return to the fold - by force if necessary. With recent dissent from Rectan locals also affecting the nation, Gebet has a difficult task ahead of it."

 SAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "£GFX_map_sapin_map\nA longstanding nation with traditions dating back centuries, Sapin has always been a critical player in the affairs of Southeast Osea. A strong ally of the Osean Federation nearly since the latter's inception. Contrasting many of the nations around it, Sapin is unique in the fact it is a monarchy, rather than a form of republic or democracy. Sapin's Royal Family, always the center of attention in the nation, are a great source of pride and unity in the nation. Despite this, growing democratic and fringe extremist ideologies, as well as the constant threat of Belka to the north, may spell doom for the kingdom's future."
 
 
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world wait anxiously for what the world brings next. Some will live, some will die. None could forsee that the history of the two would become one."
