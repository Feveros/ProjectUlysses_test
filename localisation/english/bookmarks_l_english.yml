 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Ring Of Time"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The world holds its breath as it prepares to enter the 21st century, just as it did at the beginning of the last, repeating the infinite ring of time. The decades-long Cold War between Osea and Yuktobania continues despite recent developments, as does a standoff between Erusean and UTO forces in western Usea, and an unstable Belka threatens to fall into chaos, allowing powerful weapons to fall into possibly wrong hands. The world is on the brink of what could be the new greatest conflict known to mankind. Without beginning or end, the ring stretches into the infinite."
 
 BLK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A nation with deep roots in its military, Belka has never found itself far from using force to achieve it's goals. After seeing the meteoric rise of it's rival, Osea, Belka has sought to not let itself be outpaced. Excessive military spending has allowed the nation to stay a relevant power on the world stage, at the sacrifice of it's economy, and much of it's domestic stability. Confidence in the government has reached all-time lows, and many of the people feel that new leadership and new direction is needed. With radical movements both old and new on the rise, the lack of ability to predict the future of this old northern hegemon is a terrifying reality."
 
 UST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After many years of occupation, the nation of Ustio is reborn. Annexed by Belka more than a century ago, Ustio has always preserved an independent culture from their occupiers, with eventual dreams of independence. Those dreams came true in 1988, with the ratification of the Belkan Federal Law Review, allowing Ustio to assert it's own independence from Belka. Finally liberated, now the endless task of staying independent has begun. With the world growing ever more dangerous by the day, Ustio must fight with every ounce of strength she has to not fall again, not to Belka, not to Osea, not to any nation."
 
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world wait anxiously for what the world brings next. Some will live, some will die. None could forsee that the history of the two would become one."
