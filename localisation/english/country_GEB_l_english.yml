 GEB_continue_land_reform: "Continue Land Reform"
 GEB_continue_land_reform_desc: "President [ROOT.GetLeader] ran on a platform that emphasized reducing the influence of the ethnic Belkan aristocrats in Gebetian politics and the economy. One of the most popular planks of his platform was land reform where he promised to expropriate excess land-holdings and put equally sized parcels of land onto the market for sale where only one individual could get one parcel of land from this sale."
 GEB_develop_the_countryside: "Develop The Countryside"
 GEB_develop_the_countryside_desc: "Historically, the rulers of Gebet concentrated economic expansion in the metropolitan hub of Mons and the area surrounding it known as "Old Gebet." As much as this has spurred technological and socio-economic development in the historical capital of the region, it's left much of the rural countryside underdeveloped and forgotten."
 GEB_implement_a_progressive_tax_system: "Implement A Progressive Tax System"
 GEB_implement_a_progressive_tax_system_desc: "Creating a modern progressive tax system like in the Osean Federation has been a dream of [GEB.GetLeader] since he was elected. However, since his first administration was mostly spent consolidating the government and securing our borders post-independence, he didn't have the time to allocate resources to develop the bureaucracy required to run that kind of tax system."
 GEB_liquidate_aristocrat_assets: "Liquidate Aristocrat Assets"
 GEB_liquidate_aristocrat_assets_desc: "The aristocrats of Gebet own large sums of money and assets that are worth even more money. The President's plan is to liquidate any aristocrats' assets worth over $1,000,000 and spend the money acquired from it on public goods and services."
 GEB_small_businesses_subsidization: "Small Business Subsidizations"
 GEB_small_businesses_subsidization_desc: "The lifeblood of the Gebetian economy has and always will be the middle and working class. We need to focus our government's economic investments into strengthening the middle and working class to form a strong backbone for a stable and powerful economy."
 GEB_albrecht_administration: "Albrecht Administration"
 GEB_albrecht_administration_desc: "In a stunning upset, the Progressive Democratic Party led by Rafael Albrecht has managed to win the presidency from the personally popular Ilse Ebner!"
 GEB_negotiate_with_aristocrats: "Negotiate With Aristocrats"
 GEB_negotiate_with_aristocrats_desc: "The SDU's plans to constantly antagonize the aristocrats by stripping away all of their wealth would only lead to them working closer with the Belkans to sabotage our country. We need to make sure that reform is done with the cooperation of them so that they don't do anything drastic in retaliation."
 GEB_encourage_philanthropy: "Encourage Philanthropy"
 GEB_encourage_philanthropy_desc: "One way we can engage in reform with the cooperation of the aristocrats is to encourage them to practice philanthropy to both help the average Gebetian while making themselves seem less "villainous" and gaining more favor in the eyes of the people in the process."
 GEB_trickle_down_economics: "Trickle-Down Economics"
 GEB_trickle_down_economics_desc: "If we allow the upper classes to continue to prosper and grow, surely their excess wealth will eventually "trickle down" to the rest of society."
 GEB_open_up_trade: "Open Up Trade"
 GEB_open_up_trade_desc: "Gebet is not a nation wealthy in and of itself. In order to make Gebet into a robust and flexible economy, we need to open up trade with the other parts of Osea by striking favorable deals with our neighbors in good faith."
 GEB_regional_prosperity: "Regional Prosperity"
 GEB_regional_prosperity_desc: "Our business growth and free trade policies have helped the green line go up in Gebet and in our neighbors. Good times are ahead!"
 GEB_our_violent_brothers: "Our Violent Brothers"
 GEB_our_violent_brothers_desc: "To the west of us, the Belkans have elected an ultranationalistic, extreme right-wing government into power with the hopes of it solving their economic crisis. We Gebetians know all too well of the history of Belkan nationalism that resulted in our annexation and subjugation under the boot of Dinsmark. We cannot allow another Gebetian republic to fall to Belkan authoritarianism."
 GEB_reopen_arms_factories: "Reopen Arms Factories"
 GEB_reopen_arms_factories_desc: "When we separated from the Belkans in 1988, we inherited remnants of Belka's expansive arms industry they used to supply their wars of oppression against northern Oseans. We shut down these factories as part of a policy to prioritize peace and civilian prosperity over war and conquest. Unfortunately, the time has come to rearm in the face of Belkan agitation."
 GEB_purchase_osean_arms: "Purchase Osean Arms"
 GEB_purchase_osean_arms_desc: "The Osean Federation is perhaps the greatest power on the Osean continent and, luckily for us, has an interest in combatting the Belkans. Our armories have lots of empty space and the Oseans have an expansive and advanced military industry willing to fill them."
 GEB_develop_a_new_rifle: "Develop A New Rifle"
 GEB_develop_a_new_rifle_desc: "Our soldiers are currently equipped with an old rifle from the 1960s, designed by Belkan engineers and subsequently given to Gebetian reserves as hand-me-downs. These are woefully inadequate for a full-scale war with the westward military power and we need to begin developing a modern rifle adequate for modern warfare."
 GEB_reinstate_conscription: "Reinstate Conscription"
 GEB_reinstate_conscription_desc: "During the period of Belkan rule, Gebetians were subject to a mandatory service in the Belkan Army, one that ethnic Belkans were spared of. As unpopular as a reinstatement of that policy would be, we need soldiers to stymy a Belkan offensive into our country to keep us alive."
 GEB_the_haller_plan: "The Haller Plan"
 GEB_the_haller_plan_desc: "General Janis Haller's plan to combat the Belkans is to abandon the desert area and retreat to the mountains and cities to fight the Belkans in more defensible positions."
 GEB_the_meike_line: "The Meike Line"
 GEB_the_meike_line_desc: "Adhering to Janis Haller's defense plan, we'll set up a line of fortifications on the mountains and in Old Gebet, facing towards Belka."
 GEB_form_the_gebetian_rangers: "Form The Gebetian Rangers"
 GEB_form_the_gebetian_rangers_desc: "To secure superiority in the mountains, we'll train up some "
 GEB_rail_line_defenses: "Rail Line Defenses"
 GEB_rail_line_defenses_desc: "The rail link between Mons and Silvia is crucial for Haller's defensive plan. We need to secure and fortify the railway that will be our national lifeline."
 GEB_festung_mons: "Festung Mons"
 GEB_festung_mons_desc: "As part of the Haller Plan, Mons will end up being very close to the frontlines of a war with Belka. In the event that the frontlines shift too much against our favor, Mons must be prepared to stand as a "Fortress City" capable of blunting enemy attacks."
 GEB_the_burger_plan: "The Burger Plan"
 GEB_the_burger_plan_desc: "General Christian Burger, the oldest general in the country and a veteran who formerly served in the Belkan Army, plan to fight the Belkans is to create a series of static defenses on the border with Belka to prevent them from even taking one step into Gebet."
 GEB_the_burger_line: "The Burger Line"
 GEB_the_burger_line_desc: "A series of static fortifications situated on the border with Belka will stop the Belkans directly in their tracks. Not one inch of Gebetian soil shall fall to the Belkan boot!"
 GEB_fortify_rotwald: "Fortify Rotwald"
 GEB_fortify_rotwald_desc: "The city of Rotwald is the centerpiece of our forward defensive strategy. Defending it in the event of a Belkan breakthrough on the front and protecting it from air attacks will be crucial to our success on the front."
 GEB_urban_combat_training: "Urban Combat Training"
 GEB_urban_combat_training_desc: "With the assistance of the other northern Osean states and the Osean Federation itself, we should be training our soldiers to prepare to storm Belkan cities rather than hold the line."
 GEB_establish_burger_towns: "Establish "Burger Towns""
 GEB_establish_burger_towns_desc: "General Burger plans to further fortify Rotwald by turning the suburban towns surrounding it into "mini fortress cities," or as the general likes to call them "Burger Towns" named after himself."
 GEB_the_jung_plan: "The Jung Plan"
 GEB_the_jung_plan_desc: "General Elli Jung's plan to defend the nation is to bait the Belkans into fighting us in the vast desert of the west, where we can leverage our homefield advantage to damage their logistics and leave their armies burning under the sun."
 GEB_baiting_fortifications: "Baiting Fortifications"
 GEB_baiting_fortifications_desc: "In order to bait the Belkans into bogging themselves down in the desert, we'll construct fortifications on the mountain ranges next to them to trick them into trying to go around."
 GEB_desert_training: "Desert Training"
 GEB_desert_training_desc: "If we want to have an advantage fighting in the desert, our soldiers need to be trained to fight in the desert. The good general also apparently has some idea to tame some of the creatures of the desert for usage by the Army and, well, if she thinks it'll work, she can go right on ahead."
 GEB_stauss_logistics_center: "Stauss Logistics Center"
 GEB_stauss_logistics_center_desc: "Our soldiers in the desert are going to need supplies to maintain high readiness and morale when fighting the Belkans."
 GEB_mine_the_desert: "Mine The Desert"
 GEB_mine_the_desert_desc: "The final and most crucial part of the plan is to heavily mine the desert. This will heavily hamper Belka's offensive capabilities and slow them down significantly, hopefully enough that if they do reach Mons, they'll already be too expended to be able to take the capital."
 GEB_expand_kuhn_air_force_base: "Expand Kuhn Air Force Base"
 GEB_expand_kuhn_air_force_base_desc: "Kuhn Air Force Base is well-positioned in the Granley Mountains to launch attacks on the Belkan rear and even into Belka itself. Expansion of this base is going to assist us in our future war with Belka."
 GEB_defensive_militarism: "Defensive Militarism"
 GEB_defensive_militarism_desc: "We Gebetians have prided ourselves on our rejection of Belka's aggrressive and backwards militarism and it's been a struggle trying to convince Gebetians to go along with national re-armament and conscription. However, by stressing that we're practicing "defensive militarism," rather than Belkan-style aggression, we've convinced the people to be comfortable with a pacifist but well-defended Gebet."
 GEB_phase_one_of_industrialization: "Phase One Of Industrialization"
 GEB_phase_one_of_industrialization_desc: "Gebet is an underdeveloped and unindustrialized region, kept so by our former Belkan overlords to discourage revolt by keeping the Gebetian people poor. Now that we're independent, we need to begin industrializing and developing our nation to stand on its own feet as a stable and functional economy."
 GEB_investment_in_the_capital: "Investment In The Capital"
 GEB_investment_in_the_capital_desc: "Mons is the historic center and capital of Gebet. It's where a nascent industrial economy has been developing since the end of Belkan rule and it's where we should set as the central hub of our national industrialization."
 GEB_expand_the_road_system: "Expand The Road System"
 GEB_expand_the_road_system_desc: "One of the most important aspects of an industrial economy is the interconnectivity of major cities and small towns. This interconnectivity incentivizes economic interaction and allows for the best in specific fields to be able to use their skills to their best advantage."
 GEB_mons_railway_station: "Mons Railway Station"
 GEB_mons_railway_station_desc: "While we have an expansive military railway system built by the Belkans, the city of Mons, while being a center of trade in Gebet, lacks a central passenger railway station to manage passenger rails."
 GEB_gebadia_engineering_school: "North Gebadia Engineering School"
 GEB_gebadia_engineering_school_desc: "Gebet needs a core of trained and experienced engineers to build up Gebet's industry in an efficient way and train future engineers and architects to continue our industrialization."
 GEB_subsidize_internal_trade: "Subsidize Internal Trade"
 GEB_subsidize_internal_trade_desc: "While Mons and North Gebadia have historic trade connections, the moderately sized city of Silvia has historically been considered part of the "frontier" and has existed mostly disconnected from the goings on in the Mons metropolitan area. Silvia, like all other cities, must become more integrated into the national economy and subsidizing trade between them will lead to that."
 GEB_silvia_passenger_rail: "Silvia Passenger Rail"
 GEB_silvia_passenger_rail_desc: "The city of Silvia, despite being a mountainous one, lacks a mode of easy transportation and travel across its suburban areas aside from walking dangerous mountain paths. By building a passenger rail system like that of Mons, Silvia can itself become a strong industrial base in Gebet."
 GEB_granley_mountains_iron_mines: "Granley Mountains Iron Mines"
 GEB_granley_mountains_iron_mines_desc: "The Granley Mountains are a mostly untapped mountain range in Gebet but one that is suspected to have a wealth of raw materials under them. To start, we'll open up some iron mines in areas we know have raw iron and continue funding projects to search for more raw materials in the mountains."
 GEB_complete_phase_one_of_industrialization: "Complete Phase One Of Industrialization"
 GEB_complete_phase_one_of_industrialization_desc: "The first hurdle of our industrialization is complete. We've developed a decent industrial economy in our economic center, developed a basic level of conenction between our cities, and have begun extracting the raw materials needed to build new factories and to trade with other nations for further economic growth."
 GEB_phase_two_of_industrialization: "Phase Two Of Industrialization"
 GEB_phase_two_of_industrialization_desc: "It's time to continue with our plan of industrialization across the nation to make Gebet into a strong and powerful economy that can provide for its own citizens and be an economic bedrock for northern Osea."
 GEB_north_gebadia_factories: "North Gebadia Factories"
 GEB_north_gebadia_factories: "The second major city in Gebet has a lot of people looking for work. It's the perfect place to open up new factories to expand our industry and reduce unemployment in the city."
 GEB_new_production_tools: "New Production Tools"
 GEB_new_production_tools_desc: "Our factories are woefully behind that of major industrial powers like Osea in the types of machine tooling we have available to us. We'll study some of their machines in order to improve and develop ones for our own factories."
 GEB_expand_granley_mountains_excavations: "Expand Granley Mountains Excavations"
 GEB_expand_granley_mountains_excavations_desc: "The Granley Mountains are a veritable treasure trove of raw materials that haven't been utilized. By actually extracting and utilizing these resources, we can start to strengthen the Gebetian economy and turn it into a strong trade powerhouse."
 GEB_albrecht_steelworks: "Albrecht Steelworks"
 GEB_albrecht_steelworks_desc: "A man named Aldrich Albrecht, a brother of the PDP politician Rafael Albrecht, has opened up a steelworks facility in the city of Mons."
 GEB_electrify_the_cities: "Electrify The Cities"
 GEB_electrify_the_cities_desc: "Though electricity is widely available in downtown Gebet, free and reliable electricity is not a guarantee in all Gebetian cities. It's time to electrify all our major cities to further move Gebet towards being a modern nation."
 GEB_mons_central_blast_furnace: "Mons Central Blast Furnace"
 GEB_mons_central_blast_furnace_desc: "Mons will be a great city to establish a blast furnace to process iron harvested from around the country into steel."
 GEB_silvia_smelting: "Silvia Smelting LLC."
 GEB_silvia_smelting_desc: "As we've managed to find aluminum in the Granley Mountains, entrepreneurs have seized on the opportunity and began setting up companies based around these new resources. One of these is Silvia Smelting LLC., a company based around aluminum mining and smelting."
 GEB_complete_phase_two_of_industrialization: "Complete Phase Two Of Industrialization"
 GEB_complete_phase_two_of_industrialization_desc: "The second phase of our industrialization is complete. New factories have opened up in our major cities, excavations into the Granley Mountains have been extremely fruitful, and our cities have reliable access to electricity."
 GEB_phase_three_of_industrialization: "Phase Three Of Industrialization"
 GEB_phase_three_of_industrialization_desc: "It's time to continue with our plan of industrialization across the nation.

 GEB_hydroelectric_dam_desc: "xxxx"
 GEB_improve_rural_roads: "Improve Rural Roads"
 GEB_improve_rural_roads_desc: "Gebet's rural regions are lacking in proper road infrastructure. Though we've created a basic intercity road system, we still need to make properly paved roads stretching across the whole country."

 GEB_electrify_the_countryside_desc: "Though we've made good strides in providing reliable electricity to the cities, we still need to provide reliable electricity to the entire country, especially in the countryside."

 GEB_form_gebetian_air_force_desc: "Gebet currently lacks a formal air force. What few air assets we do have are either volunteers or part of the Gebetian Army. By having a dedicated air force to manage and coordinate our air assets, we'll get more out of each one."
 GEB_faulmann_doctrine: "The Faulmann Doctrine"
 GEB_faulmann_doctrine_desc: "Jakob Faulmann is the most experienced pilot in all of Gebet. He believes that the best way to utilize our minimal air assets is with lightning fast precision strikes on enemy military targets to assist the Army and keep our airpower as safe as possible."

 GEB_develop_new_strike_aircraft_desc: "We're currently reliant on decades-old hand-me-downs from the era of Belkan control over Gebet. We need to fund the research and development of a new strike aircraft that can be considered comparable to that of what Belka and Osea can produce."

 geb_canton_system_desc: "The Gebetian Confederation is made up of a system of cantons with a large degree of autonomy from the central government in Mons."
 geb_anti_belka: "The "Anti-Belka""
 geb_anti_belka_desc: "Gebet is considered by many to be the "Anti-Belka," a country with a shared history and culture with the Belkans but which strayed from them vastly in terms of political development. Where the Belkans chose militarism, we Gebetians opted for pacifism. Where the Belkans chose centralization, we chose regional autonomy. Where the Belkans chose reactionary authoritarianism, we chose democratic liberalism."
 geb_nonexistent_air_force: "Non-Existent Air Force"
 geb_nonexistent_air_force_desc: "Gebet has almost no air assets to speak of, save for a single strike aircraft that Jakob Faulmann donated into the military's service, and no aerial organizational structure to speak of. This has heavily hampered our military's ability to conduct air operations and many don't see a need to have one while we have next to no airpower."

 ### EVENTS
 gebet.2.t: "Philanthropy"
 gebet.2.desc: "A wealthy Gebetian businessman has decided to use his personal wealth to build [?gebet_philanthropy_building] in [FROM.GetName]. This act of generosity is thanks to our push to convince wealthy Gebetians to give back to the community.\n\nSome do argue, however, that it's not an act of generosity but rather a way for these "aristocrats" to increase their own popularity and wealth."
 gebet.2.a: "The gesture is appreciated"
 gebet_election.1.t: "1992 National Elections"
 gebet_election.1.desc: "The 1992 elections have come around with the frontrunners being the two major parties of the Social Democratic Union and the Progressive Democratic Party.\n\nThe Social Democratic Union campaigned on a platform of continued land reform, building a progressive tax system, developing the infrastructure of rural regions, making the aristocrats "pay their fair share," and focusing on strengthening the middle and lower class.\n\nThe Progressive Democratic Party has campaigned on cutting regulations passed by the SDU, lowering taxes, and freeing up trade. All in stark contrast to the policies of the SDU.\n\nThe two opposing parties are now waiting in anticipation to see who won over the people."
 gebet_election.1.a: "Ilse Ebner and the SDU wins!"
 gebet_election.1.b: "Rafael Albrecht and the PDP wins!"
 gebet_belkan_war.1.t: "Faulmann Takes Off"
 gebet_belkan_war.1.desc: "Upon the outbreak of war, one of the first notable reports, out of many, was that the old Gebetian ace, Jakob "Raider" Faulmann, immediately took off from Kuhn Air Force Base the moment he heard about the outbreak of war. He turned off his transponder, but the people of the air base state that he was flying westward towards Belka, fully armed with missiles and bombs.\n\nHis intentions are not unclear, however. He left an envelope in the hangar his plane was stored in with a note and a set of pictures.\n\nThe pictures contained aerial pictures of a burning city, detailed enough to show civilians being burned alive by napalm bombs. Each picture is marked with the words "Rectan War."\n\nHow he got his hands on these pictures is unclear but the note simply states "I won't let this happen to us."\n\nHis intentions are clear. He wants to go launch an attack on the Belkans himself, military doctrine be damned."
 gebet_belkan_war.1.a: ""Godspeed, Taube 1.""
 gebet_belkan_war.2.t: "A Taste of Their Own Medicine"
 gebet_belkan_war.2.desc: "Flying high above [faulmann_raid_victim.GetName], Faulmann analyzed his on-board optics, scanning for and mentally marking targets for his raid. He'd been able to avoid detection by the Belkans by using the IFF frequency in his plane from back in his days in the Belkan Air Force.\n\nHe made sure to make a point with his attack. He'd defected from the Belkan Air Force after a brutal Belkan bomber raid on a Rectan civilian center during the Rectan War. He'd watched the bombers carpet the city in napalm bombs to root out what they believed were rebel forces.\n\nThis time, things would be different. He wouldn't stoop to their level. He'd do what he'd gotten his callsign for doing, hitting them with precision strikes on strictly military targets.\n\nAfter his run was successful, he started flying away from the burning wrecks of military equipment, logistics hubs, and railroads and began heading home. It was then he saw some planes fly behind him on his radar. Turning to see who the Belkans had sent to pursue him, he saw the liveries of his old Belkan squadron. The planes also seemed to recognize him as they kept a lock on him and held it there without firing.\n\nThis continued until he went outside of Belkan radar range, at which point each of the planes pursuing him launched a single missile harmlessly into the distance and turned back towards Belka, allowing Faulmann to land safely."
 gebet_belkan_war.2.a: ""Nice to see you too...""
 gebet_belkan_war.3.t: "Dinsmark In Flames"
 gebet_belkan_war.3.desc: "President [ROOT.GetLeader] sat in his office, sipping some tea as he looked over reports from the front, seeing how the initial offensive was going.\n\nHe figured that the sheer strength of Belkan technology and willpower will overwhelm the lazy and degenerate forces of the so-called "Allied Forces" led by the old enemy of Osea.\n\nA smirk crawled across his face as he looked at a report from a successful battle on the Gebetian front and--\n\n*BOOM!*\n\nA series of explosions rocked Dinsmark and the presidential palace violently shook from the shockwaves, causing the president to look out his now cracked windows and see a lone jet fly across the sky, pursued by the 211th "Eule" Fighter-Bomber squadron.\n\nSlowly, the shaken president sat down, cursing at the sight of his tea cup broken on the floor with his morning drink spilled onto the carpet.\n\nIn a fit of anger, he picked up the phone and immediately dialed the military high command."
 gebet_belkan_war.3.a: ""Replace the head of the capital's air defense! NOW!""
 gebet_belkan_war.4.t: "[faulmann_raid_victim.GetName] Attacked!"
 gebet_belkan_war.4.desc: "Reports are coming in from [faulmann_raid_victim.GetName] detailing a raid by a mysterious plane that left pillars of smoke dotting the area.\n\nAccording to the reports, the plane destroyed almost every military target in the area and, surprisingly, caused zero civilian casualties.\n\nApparently, the plane avoided detection by spoofing our IFF in some way and proceeded to launch precision strikes on our military assets in the region. It hit them so quickly that our air defense systems were unable to respond in time before they were destroyed.\n\nAccording to the ace squadron we sent to intercept it, the 211th "Eule" Fighter-Bomber Squadron, the plane was able to avoid being shot down and get away with sheer speed and maneuverability, even getting a lock on one of our interceptors, although briefly."
