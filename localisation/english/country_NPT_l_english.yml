 NPT_militarist_isolationism_idea: "Militarist Isolationism"
 NPT_militarist_isolationism_idea_desc: "Our nation has a history and tradition of maintaining a well-regarded military force while expressing strong isolationist tendencies."
 NPT_democratic_stratocracy_idea: ""Democratic Stratocracy""
 NPT_democratic_stratocracy_idea_desc: "Our collection of islands are run in a unique way. There's no central governing system, with all domestic politics being managed by the democratically-elected governments of our many subdivisions. At the same time, all our foreign and military affairs are handled by a meritocratic military council known as the "National Defense Council."\n\nMost of the public is fine with this status quo but there's a not-insignificant and growing minority of people who want our government to change.\n\nOn one hand, the Democratic Republican Party (DRP) wants to do away with the National Defense Council's role in politics, relegating it to solely operating military affairs, and establish a democratically-elected central government.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a group of young officers in the Defense Forces, the self-titled "Reformists," that want to make the National Defense Council a strong central authority of the islands' domestic politics."
