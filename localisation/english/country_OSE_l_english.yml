 ose_elections_dockyards_desc: "With Osea covering much of the coastline of the world, maritime trade and transportation are integral to our economy and the lives of many Oseans.

 ose_refund_the_land_desc: "The Osean Ground Defense Force has been unfortunately forgotten about due to previous administrations focusing on a prospective war with Yuktobania rather than the notion of a ground war on the Osean continent.

 ### Events ###
 
 osea_glrdc.1.t: "Belkan Troubles"
 osea_glrdc.1.d: "A couple days ago, the government of the Belkan Federation, our neighbor and rival, became bankrupt and the the residing conservative BNCP was ousted, allowing the more liberal Alternative Wege to seize power. If it was not clear enough, Belka is in an extremely unstable state right now, and it's nearly impossible to predict where the country could be heading next. Given both their desperate situation, and the friendliness towards our country expressed by the new President, Niklaus Weber, some advisors have presented a plan for an opportunity to spin the situation to our advantage to President Andrews."
 osea_glrdc.1.a: "Opportunities abound."
 
 osea_glrdc.2.t: "Reclaiming the Great Lakes"
 osea_glrdc.2.d: "In 1905, our planned annexation of the Democratic Republic of the Great Lakes was thwarted by a sudden Belkan invasion of the country, as they too had eyes on the territory. Due to a tense relationship and a mixup on the ground, we ended up going to war with the Belkans that day, in what would become the Osean War. The war ended in a status quo, and while we kept much of the former territory, sizable portions of the nation including it's capital, Wesson, were lost to the Belkans, despite our promise to protect their people. This has remained a stain on our history throughout the century, however we may be able to finally rectify this.\n\nIn 1988, as a part of the Belkan Federal Law Review, several member nations in the Federation's eastern territories were allowed to secede and declare their independence. We had been secretly supporting these independence movements to destabilize Belka, and as it paid off then, it may be able to pay off at least one more time as well. If Belka is willing to part with some of their land to get out of a desperate situation once, it's likely we could get them to do it again. The advisors have presented President Andrews with a plan to first offer to pay for the purchase of the territories, as well as pay for further secessions to the Eastern countries, a deal which we will greatly overpay for to make them unable to refuse. Then, using the proposition of a joint excavation company, we will trick the Belkans into spending all the money from the purchase, forcing them into a vulnerable state and forcing their hand into future possible "cooperations" with us."
 osea_glrdc.2.a: "We haven't forgotten."
 
 osea_glrdc.3.t: "A Pivotal Choice"
 osea_glrdc.3.d: "The first stage of our plan has gone excellently, and the Belkans are none the wiser. Niklaus Weber is under our thumb. However, this itself has presented a new opportunity, and there is much division in our inner circles on which option is more beneficial. The original plan involves setting up a joint resource company in our recently purchased territories, which, as we know, posess little to no natural resources. This would dry up all of Belka's money from our trade deal, throwing them back into poverty once again. After this, it would only be a matter of time before Belka either loses control of its military or liquidates it, leaving them as a destabilized minor power of little significance to us, allowing us to fully focus on curbing Yuktobania.\n\nThe other plan, proposed by some of the more liberal members, would be to instead base the company in Ustio, where we have gotten reports of vast underground resources. Doing this would prove our honesty to the Belkans, allowing us to gain favor with them, and as some have suggested, even a possible alliance. This would also most likely put the Belkans back on their feet, restabilizing them under the Alternative Wege, the government most friendly to us.\n\nDebate is rampant in Bright Hill on which plan to choose, with tensions reaching paramount heights. The former option is more reliable in the initial stages, and would gurantee the largest gain from us, as well as allow us to take the real resources in Ustio for ourselves, and prevent Belka from potentially backstabbing us when recovered. However, plunging Belka back into chaos will cause a great amount of unpredictability, and the situation could develop extremely poorly if not managed well. On the other hand, the latter option is highly variable and could result in either a signifcantly worse or a significantly better outcome than the first plan. It has the potential to portray us globally as a peacemaker and forgiver, increasing our support abroad compared to the Yuktobanians. In addition, the possibility of a stable Belka as our ally would be a large blow to Yuktobanian influence, as we would be completely uncontested in the entire Osean continent. Not to mention how big of an asset Belkan scientists and commanders would be to our nation. However, none of this is guranteed, and the possibility always exists that the Belkans will backstab us or demand the return of their territory once they are stabilized. It's unlikely for them to forget our near century of rivalry, after all. This would also mean we would get a smaller cut of the Ustian resources as well. Lastly, many Oseans do not like the prospect of cooperation with Belka. Our land purchase, while praised for it's benefits, was criticized by more nationalistic groups of our nation, proclaiming we owe Belka nothing and should have simply invaded the territories. These people would likely be in high opposition if we were to continue dealings with Belka, a sentiment reinforced by the Nationalist Union members in our own government. As a result, there is likely to be sizable backlash for our actions if we take this route. Unable to reach a consensus, the final decision rests with the President."
 osea_glrdc.3.a: "Belka will pay for her victims.(Option 2 coming soon!)"
 osea_glrdc.3.b: "It's time to bury the hatchet."
 
 osea_belka_land.1.t: "Belkan Resistance in the Great Lakes"
 osea_belka_land.1.d: "While we may have promised liberation to the old owners of this land, that was a rather long time ago and the truth is that the majority of people who live there now mostly consider themselves Belkans through and through. Because of this, only days after moving in we are already recieving reports of protests and discontent with our regime. This was expected, of course, but will take some time to deal with. Eventually we will formally integrate these annexed territories into our federal system, however the region will need to cool off before that can be done. The locals have been living in near poverty from the Belkan Economic Crisis, and have been protesting their own country for quite some time now so it is understandable that they immediately began doing that upon our arrival. With a little time, and some investments into the region improving the quality of life, the Great Lakes region will be integrated into our nation easily. Until then, however, this will be a thorn in our side."
 osea_belka_land.1.a: "Sorry for being so late, Wesson."
 
 osea_belka_land.2.t: "Integrating the Great Lakes"
 osea_belka_land.2.d: "After the Osean War ended in 1910, the territory that we had managed to protect was turned into a new administrative region, the Great Lakes. This continued until the reform turning former Regions into Commonwealths, when it was the backbone of the Eastern Commonwealth. The six Commonwealths form the middlemen between the leadership of our country and the people, and are a crucial part of the representation of citizens across the nation. While not ready to be added into the Eastern Commonwealth yet, pledging our goal to be to have them added to it will be a good motivator for the people to cooperate with us in restoring their livelihood. As a mere occupied territory right now, the citizens of the area do not have the same civil liberties as Osean citizens. Rather than ignoring this, showing that we seek to have them represented in our nation should please them and make them more receptive to our rule."
 osea_belka_land.2.a: "Time to get to work."
 
 osea.1.t: "1991 Defense White Paper"
 osea.1.d: "The National Security Council has released the 1991 Defense White Paper outlining what Osea's defense strategy will be for the upcoming decade.\n\nThe paper focuses on the Yuktobanian threat across the Ceres Ocean and the need for the Osean Defense Forces to focus on developing its aerial and naval forces to control the Ceres Ocean and soften up the Yuktobanian coastline for a potential amphibious invasion."
 osea.1.a: "Better dead than red!"
 
 osea.20.t: "Campaign Season"
 osea.20.d: "As 1991 draws to a close, the people's minds begin to turn to the election due in July of next year. Incumbent President Daniel Andrews of the Unity Party has seen good success throughout his presidency, and seeing as this is merely his first term, the Unity Party is riding on his re-election with a high probability of success. Andrews' Rearmament Declaration at the start of his presidency followed by his comittment to safeguard Osean interests around the globe kicked off his reputation well, and the recent political defeat of Belka, removing a longtime rival of Osea and fulfilling a century-old promise to the Great Lakers simutaneously has greatly increased his popularity with the more hawkish and hardline conservatives, giving him a sizable lead off the Liberty Party. For his second term, Andrews has promised full integration of the Great Lake territories, as well as using their newfound breathing room from Belka to redirect pressure to the Union of Yuktobanian Republics, giving Osea a significant lead in the Cold War.\n\nOpposing Andrews is the Liberty Party's new candidate, Tyler Mackenzie. One of the youngest candidates to ever be chosen, Mackenzie strongly believes that Belka's large military, nationalistic tendencies, and close proximity to Osea makes them a much greater threat than Yuktobania, who he argues Osea should be seeking detente with, instead of carrying the Cold War on into the 21st century. As it stands now, Mackenzie does not have a strong platform to go off of, and the standings are weighted heavily in Andrews' favor currently."
 osea.20.a: "Elections already?"
 
 osea.21.t: "The Perblan Menace"
 osea.21.d: "Our southern neighbor, the Kingdom of Perbla, has never been on good terms with us. With wars commonplace between them and a predecessor nation of ours, the National Republic of Shannon, it's understandable that they would not be amicable to us. Worse still, this has led them to pursue friendly relations with our rival Belka, forming a deadly alliance that skewers us from two angles. The narrowness of the border and the relative state of peace that has existed for some time now has led many to forget the potential threat a Perblan attack has on the heartland of our nation. President Andrews has started a media campaign reminding Oseans of the threat to our south, putting our citizens into a far more hawkish mood, especially those living in our southern regions, as well as swaying them in our favor, showing that we care about their safety and wellbeing from foreign threats."
 osea.21.a: "Our borders must be secure."
 
 osea.22.t: "Our Greatest Enemy"
 osea.22.d: ""My fellow Oseans, I ask you, what is our greatest enemy? Is it the Yuktobanian who seeks to undermine our nation and way of life? Is it the Belkan who sabre-rattles at our borders and threatens to trample us? Not in the slightest! While these forces are indeed a great threat to our wellbeing, as is any nation or people who seeks to disrupt the forces of freedom and democracy worldwide, the greatest threat to Osea is herself. For the only force great enough to topple Osea is the voice of her own people, disunited and shattered, divided and soon to be conquered by her rivals. I urge of you, my fellow Oseans, to judge carefully those around you. Do they stand up to the examples of our forefathers? Do you trust them with the power to make choices in regards to our future, and any threats to our nation that may arise? Would they stand united with us against it, or would they kneel to it? My fellow Oseans, our greatest enemy lies not within the borders of other nations but within our own. Our greatest enemy is the decay that festers within our own nation, that holds us back and causes discord in our ranks! How are we to forge a path forward for the world, and combat the many lies and evils that threaten us if we cannot even unite as one voice, as one nation, to declare who we are? We must all take heart as one and expose these enemies where they stand, and shun them as they shun us! My fellow Oseans, every vote you place for Unity will be one more voice in the grand chorus, one more string in the tapestry of our nation, and most importantly, one less deviant from our destiny!""
 osea.22.a: "The crowd erupted in cheers."
 
 osea.23.t: "Threat of the DLP"
 osea.23.d: ""One concern recently expressed by our citizens is the rise of the nationalist Democratic Liberal Party in Belka, especially so soon after the failure of the Great Lakes Resource Development Company. Do you two have any comments on this matter?"\n\n"We extended the olive branch as best we could, but in the end, Belka is just completely lost. They couldn't work with us to keep the company up for even a minimal amount of time! But there is a silver lining in this. Belka is no longer a factor in our lives. They will not threaten us any more. You have my word on that. Where our focus should really be is on the Yukes. They've been silent for a while, but trust me when I say I know they've got something big-"\n\n"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Mr. President, but before we move onto another topic we'd like to hear Mr. Mackenzie's thoughts. Mr. Mackenzie?"\n\n"Frankly, Mr. President, and my fellow people of Osea, I believe we have made a grave mistake in our treatment of Belka. The DLP is very clearly not fond of us, and no matter how unstable they may appear, make no mistake that their military is still extremely formidable. And let us not forget that the party itself even has ties to the military leadership. I believe that as long as they reign, a violent Belka will always-"\n\n"They have no money! Where will their soldiers' wages come from? Anything they try will fall flat on it's face, just like the GLRDC! The Yukes are the-"\n\n"And let us not forget who proposed the GLRDC? The Wege was our best chance at mending the relations between us, and now we're stuck with angry fascists! Hell, they're probably more dangerous than the Y-"'\n\n"You can't mend relations with the Belkans! They'll never cooperate with us! Those selfish-"\n\n\n"Dear viewers, please excuse us. We'll be back after these messages.""
 osea.23.a: "This happens every year."
 
 osea.24.t: "Opinions on Yuktobania"
 osea.24.d: ""Welcome back to our program. Gentlemen, many Oseans believe the Cold War seems to have come to a stalemate for the time being, with no real developments on either side. What are your thoughts on the Cold War and it's future?"\n\n"If we are not ahead in the Cold War, we are losing. With Belka out of the picture, my primary goal this next term will be a full focus on combating Yuktobanian influence worldwide. Yuktobania is the greatest threat to freedom and democracy the world has ever known. They have stalled out, giving us the chance to strike before they regain their footing. I promise you, my fellow Oseans, no Yuke will ever step foot on anywhere in Osea."\n\n(Cheers are heard throughout the audience)\n\n"I think this is a crucial moment in our time. We have been so busy trying to contain Yuktobania these past few decades, and them trying to contain us, it's just dragging us down at this point. Make no mistake, Osean independence and self-sufficience is very important to me, but frankly I think spending all our money and resources to fight a nation that's across an ocean from us while our own people suffer and starve? It just doesn't make sense to me. I care about the Osean people and their wellbeing more than some political game of smoke and mirrors."\n\n"Well Tyler, if you care so much about the Osean people, why don't you care about keeping them safe from communism? I know this is hard for you Liberties to swallow, but they're not our friends! They hate us! You're telling us to make friends with a wild, hungry tiger!"\n\n"Now now, that's not what I said. I'm not a fool, I know the current administration is not friendly toward us. However, I have seen with my own eyes that in Yuktobania the ice of the Cold War is thawing. Much like us, many people are struggling and are upset to see resources that could help them fueling an endless war machine. The Cold War won't end today, but who's to say the Yuktobanians will feel the same tomorrow? When the day comes that our nations are ready to move on from this dark chapter, I will be at the helm guiding us into a new era of peace."\n\n"They're playing you Tyler. They're playing you like a little puppet on a string-\n\n"Ahem. Thank you, gentlemen, unfortunately that's all the time we have for today. Coming up next on our around-the-clock election coverage, we've got an update on recent polls.""
 osea.24.a: "It's more entertainment than education."
 
 osea.25.t: "The Interview"
 osea.25.d: "'Mr. Mackenzie, do you believe the recent developments in Belka are of an isolated incident, or a part of something larger?"\n\n"Something larger, no doubt about it. A nation cannot stay in chaos forever. So as long as a people are determined, they will right themselves, and I believe we're seeing this unfold right now in Belka. Worse still, and I cannot emphasize this enough, our recent actions towards the Belkans has irrepairably harmed our relations. I do not believe any future Belkan government will be willing to cooperate with us, let along the current administration. It is my firm belief that President Andrews had the potential to end our bitter history with Belka once and for all, and completely squandered it."\n\n"Do you belive the DLP's Belka poses a threat to Osea?"\n\n"Absolutely, sir. In their eyes, we have stolen their land, people, and assets away from them. Don't forget -  These people still posess an extremely formidible military, especially with the DLP's own militarist wing. If I did not know any better, I would guess that Belka will seek to exact their revenge on us within the next... say four years? Yet President Andrews insists they are 'gone for good.' I strongly believe this militarist, nationalist Belka is the greatest threat to our nation right now, and the worst part is that we created it."\n\n"A very interesting insight, Mr. Mackenzie. Let's move on to viewer questions. Starting off...""
 osea.25.a: "A terrifyingly plausible truth."
 
 osea.30.t: "A New Platform"
 osea.30.d: "Over the past few weeks, Mackenzie's popularity in the polls has been slowly creeping upwards. What seemed like a landslide seems to have slid back into a toss-up, as Mackenzie's predictions about Belka seem to become truer by the day, President Andrews can no longer be sure of his re-election. The Unity Party has been performing massive stunts to swing the public's attention away from Belka and onto Yuktobania, but as the Liberty Party throws everything behind Mackenzie and the truth of Belka's situation seems to become more obvious, it's unlikely they'll be able to pretend nothing is happening for long. Admitting to the truth however, would prove Mackenzie's accusations right, and would be a possibly unrecoverable blow to President Andrews' popularity."
 osea.30.a: "Now it's getting exciting!"
 
 osea.40.t: "The 1992 Osean Federal Elections"
 osea.40.d: "Today is the day. Ballot boxes all over Osea are stuffed to the brim by eager voters wishing to make their voice heard in the upper halls of Bright Hill. A tight toss-up between Andrews and Mackenzie, with no clear winner discernable from polls, citizens have no choice but to sit in anticipation for the final results to be announced. The media has been greatly enjoying the tension of this election, with exclusive interviews, polls, and event coverage raking in millions of viewers. Voting went mostly smoothly throughout the nation, aside from local incidents and a noteworthy disturbance at an rural Oured ballot box caused by OPP troublemakers. However, as the day draws to a close, and the votes are all tallied, the people of Osea finally hear, as the last ballot is counted, that the winner of the election is..."
 osea.40.a: "§CLiberty Party§! candidate Tyler Mackenzie! (Other paths coming soon!)"
 
 osea.41.t: "President Mackenzie Elected"
 osea.41.d: "As the results were tallied, the numbers were extremely close but it appears that Tyler Mackenzie has edged out the incumbent Daniel Andrews just barely, securing the presidency for the Liberty Party for the next term. Initial reports were contested and several recounts were performed at the demand of the President, however the results were clear. While not initially having a sizable platform against Andrews, his blunder against Belka last year opened an opportunity for Mackenize to make several predictions about Belka, which quickly began to take shape, making the former President look rather foolish. This upset has gotten extensive media attention, and many are praising Mackenzie as the hero of an underdog story. As the preparations for transfer of power are made, Mackenzie is expected to be inagurated within the next month."
 osea.41.a: "Congratulations, Mr. President."
 
 osea.50.t: "The Inaguration of President Mackenzie"
 osea.50.d: "Tyler Mackenzie was inagurated today as the new President of the Osean Federation. As a member of the Liberty Party, Mackenzie has a large focus on maintaining and expanding individual rights and the rights of the Commonwealths. Most notably, he has a large focus on urban welfare programs, hoping to reduce crime, homelessness, and other issues within large urban centers. While this does leave rural areas somewhat by the wayside, Mackenzie also has plans for large transportations reforms, making it easier to travel throughout the country. In terms of foreign police, Mackenzie is much the opposite of his predecessor, seeking detente with the Union of Yuktobanian Republics, and while originally encouraging cooperation with Belka, after the rise of the DLP he has switched to a hostile stance on them, declaring the DLP to be imprisoning and poisoning the Belkan people. Reactions to this result have been mixed, with the main backlash coming from the Unity Party and our allies, who believe Mackenzie to be an inexperienced, weak-kneed pacifist and communist sympathizer, while many liberal citizens and other nations breathe a sigh of relief from Andrews' hawkishness."

 osea.74.t: "A New Threat"
 osea.74.d: "News has just reached us that the head of the militarist wing of Belka's ruling party, Waldemarr Rald, has seized control of the government through a coup, and now has effective control of the country and most importantly - it's military. It seems that his predecessor's attempts to revive the economy by downsizing the military had upset Rald and his faction, whom wanted to keep the military strong. This makes our situation all the more precarious, given our recent actions towards Belka it is possible that Rald may try to reclaim the territory sold to us, likely with force. President Mackenzie has already called up the top brass of the Osean military as well as several of his advisors on how to prepare for a potential Belkan attack. Though they do not seem interested in us yet, and are more concerned with solidifying their position, there is no telling what Rald has planned for the future of his nation."
 osea.74.a: "Mackenzie's prophecy comes true."
 
 osea.75.t: "Threatening Maneuvers"
 osea.75.d: "Coinciding with the recent discovery of natural resources in Ustio, a number of urgent reports have been brought to our attention of the Belkan military conducting nationwide exercises and war games throughout their country. This is more than a simple routine, as their training and preparation seems to be around the clock, as well as in many types of terrain, most notably mountains, forests, and deserts, common elements on their borders with other nations. Additionally, we are beginning to see Belkan borders become tighter and more heavily militarized, far beyond a mere garrison. All these factors point to clear preparation for an invasion of one or all of their neighbors, likely in a bid to reclaim their land. While we have not disclosed this information to the public, President Mackenzie and our military command has already prepared a defensive operation for a possible Belkan attack, as well as we are reaching out diplomatically to Belka's neighbors in attempts to both warn and secure mutual alliances with them."
 osea.75.a: "We won't give up without a fight!"
 
 osea.76.t: "Urgent War Committee Formed"
 osea.76.d: "Responding to the recent aggression shown by Belka, President Mackenzie has created the Urgent War Committee to assist in the preparation and defence of our nation against Belka. Comprised of several members of the military, government, and other federal institutions, the Urgent War Committe will be our foremost organizational defence against Belka, both before an invasion and during. Through quick-response communication lines and emergency authority granted to several members, the UWC will allow us to adapt and respond to any new developments within a matter of hours. With any luck, the UWC will be a vital asset to us in a Belkan invasion."
 osea.76.a: "Come and get us, Belkans!"
 
 osea.77.t: "Belkan Invasion"
 osea.77.d: "Early this morning, reports of Belkan fighters violating our airspace in several areas were recieved, quickly followed by reports of Belkan divisions crossing the border into our territory. Through our quick communication lines, our garrisons were sucessfully mobilized and this initial surprise attack was supressed, however reinforcements have begun to arrive and our garrisons are starting to fall. Shortly after this surprise attack, Waldemarr Rald formally declared war on not just us, but also the nations of Sapin, Ustio, Recta, Gebet, and FATO. Against ourselves, Sapin, and FATO, Rald cites: "unlawful occupation and annexation of rightful Belkan land" as his reason for invading. For Ustio, Gebet, and Recta, he cites: "unlawful secession under illegitimate circumstances," likely referring to the Belkan Federal Law Review of 1988. With Belka still posessing their large military, it is likely the war ahead of us will be long and grueling. Sapin and Ustio have formed an official alliance with us, while the nations of Gebet, Recta, and FATO have preferred to form their own alliance, however they have agreed to some levels of cooperation with us. Given Rald's ruthlessness and patriotism, it is unlikely we will be able to restore peace until he is toppled from power. The road ahead will be difficult, but Oseans don't give up."
 osea.77.a: "Hold the line at all costs!"
  
 osea.81.t: "The Public's Reaction"
 osea.81.d: "The difficult part of waging war in a nation like Osea is managing the public's perception and support of the war. Since this is a defensive war against an authoritarian, evil foe, the public will likely be on our side for a while, especially after President Mackenzie predicted the truth. However, as the casualities trickle up and families are left without sons and fathers, our support will wane the further this war drags on, especially if we do not see results. Already some people have spoken up, claiming we should return the obtained territories to Belka to appease them, however we will not do so unless absolutely necessary. We will need to carefully manage the public's perception to the war if we wish to see ourselves victorious.

 osea_oia.1.desc: "OIA agents embedded in Belka have reported to us that some elements within the Belkan military have created an emergency plan in the case of a Belkan defeat in the war. According to the report, the plan would be to prevent an invasion of the Belkan "holy land," which is footnoted as meaning the historic Belkan homeland north of the Waldreich Mountains, by deploying seven nuclear weapons on the Waldreich Mountains, creating a wall of stone and radiation that would stop any Allied advance in its tracks."

 osea_gwot.1.t: "AWWNB Rises Up In Belka"
 osea_gwot.1.desc: "From the ashes of the former Belkan Federation, an anarchist group known as "A World With No Boundaries" has made their move in the nuclear-wasted land and risen up.\n\nReinforced by defectors from the Belkan and even Allied militaries, the group seems to plan on using the geographically secure region of Belka's "holy land" as a base of operations for their worldwide aspirations. What those may be are still uncertain.\n\nBeing the now-dominant power on the Osean continent, the question falls to us, [ROOT.GetNameDef], to decide how to handle these new developments. Do we intervene to assist the Belkan government directly, send them strictly materiel aid, or stay out of it and allow our oldest enemy to further degrade itself?"
 osea_gwot.1.a: "We should stay out of it. Let Belka kill itself from within."
 osea_gwot.1.b: "Intervention would be unpopular but we can't ignore the threat."
 osea_gwot.1.c: "Public opinion be damned, we need to do something about these anarchists!"

 OSE_congress_party_desc_unity_loc: "Founded in 1869, the Unity Party was Osea's first official political party.\n\nCreated in a time of regionalism and conflict, its founders sought the establishment of a more centralized Osean state and the creation and promotion of a unified national identity.\n\nIn the modern day, it is Osea's mainline conservative party and is primarily focused on controlling or neutering threats to the great Osean nation."
 OSE_congress_party_desc_liberty_loc: "The Liberty Party is the antithesis of the Unity Party.\n\nOriginally founded in 1891 by a coalition of politicians dissatisfied with the Unity Party's policies and ideals, the party would not rise to prominence until after the failure of the Osean War and people began to lose trust in the Unity Party and its "big government" style.\n\nIn the modern day, it is Osea's mainline liberal party and focused on increasing personal liberties, improving domestic conditions, and ending extremism abroad."
 OSE_congress_party_desc_nationalist_union_loc: "The Nationalist Union is a coalition of the Osean Brotherhood and Oured Purity Party, two far right militaristic parties.\n\nThe Osean Brotherhood wants to completely abolish with Osea's federal system and turn it into a unitary state and bringing as much of society under the purview of the state as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oured Purity Party is an old school regionalist faction made up of people descended from the leaders of the ancient merchant government of Oured. They uphold Ouredians as superior, treat other Oseans as second-class citizens, and want that to be the law of the land.\n\nDespite these differences, the two parties formed a coalition in hopes of eventually tipping the scales in their favor."
 OSE_congress_party_desc_socialist_loc: "Founded in 1901, the Socialist Party of Osea was founded by a group of union bosses and intellectuals in order to expand the rights of Osean workers.\n\nThroughout the early 20th century, the Socialists had little electoral success but succeeded in organizing demonstrations that pressured the Osean government to expand rights Osean workers.\n\nHowever, as the Cold War between Osea and Yuktobania began to develop, the party split over who to support. In a narrow party election, the pro-Yuktobanian faction won the party's leadership and the pro-Osean faction left and merged with the Liberty Party's "Progressive Caucus." Since then, the SPO has been seen as nothing more than a tool of Yuktobanian destabilization efforts."
 OSE_congress_party_desc_monarchist_loc: "Monarchism has never really been a popular ideology in Osea by any means.\n\nAny monarchists that do exist are few and far between with little to no coordination and mostly isolated to extremist internet forums."
 OSE_congress_party_desc_independent_loc: "Independents describe a group of people who do not align with any of the parties or ideologies listed above.\n\nThis is either because they don't believe in participating in partisan politics out of principle, because their support of a party often swings drastically between elections, or because they don't feel any of the established parties or groups adequately represents them."
